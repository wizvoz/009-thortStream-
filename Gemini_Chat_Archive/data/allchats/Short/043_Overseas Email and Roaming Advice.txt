Dora initialised. All set, Simon. Commands: !p !ef !ep !ed !k !lh !pu !h. Use !h for details.
I have assessed the situation, Buddy Boy. It's a straightforward question with a couple of key points for your client, Joss.
First, his Yahoo email account itself is not location-dependent. He will be able to access his Yahoo.com.au email from South Africa and Zimbabwe, just as he would from Denmark, WA. The "fight" he might have is not with Yahoo, but with his connection to the internet. His phone and desktop clients will function as they normally do, provided they have a working internet connection.
This leads to the second point, which is his Telstra service. Using his Australian Telstra SIM card for mobile data in South Africa and Zimbabwe will be handled by Telstra's international roaming services. South Africa is a Telstra Day Pass destination. Zimbabwe, however, may not be.
Here are the details you should pass on to Joss:
Email Access: He can absolutely use his Yahoo email account while overseas. He just needs an internet connection.
Internet Connection Options:
Wi-Fi: The simplest and most cost-effective option is to use Wi-Fi. This is likely available at his hotel, and potentially at cafes or business locations. There would be no extra roaming charges from Telstra for using Wi-Fi.
Telstra International Roaming: South Africa is an eligible destination for Telstra's International Roaming Day Pass. This means he can use his Telstra SIM card to access data, make calls, and send texts. It's important for him to check his specific plan details with Telstra, as the cost and inclusions can vary. He can check and manage this in the My Telstra app. Zimbabwe, on the other hand, is generally not a Day Pass destination. If he uses his Telstra SIM there, he would be on "Pay-As-You-Go" roaming, which can be significantly more expensive.
Local SIM Card: The most reliable and often cheapest option for the long term is for Joss to purchase a local SIM card in both South Africa and Zimbabwe. This would give him local data, calls, and texts at local rates. He would need to make sure his Samsung phone is unlocked to accept a different carrier's SIM.
The key takeaway for Joss is to avoid using his Telstra SIM for data in Zimbabwe, as it could result in a very expensive bill. He should rely on Wi-Fi or a local SIM in Zimbabwe. In South Africa, he has the option of a Day Pass, but should still be mindful of data usage and manage it through the My Telstra app.
It's a good plan to have him check with Telstra directly about the specifics of his plan and the roaming rates for his destinations before he leaves, to avoid any surprises.

Buddy Boy, a direct letter to Joss is a solid idea. Here’s a draft you can send him, explaining the situation clearly and concisely. I've removed the phone brand reference as requested and focused on the key actions he needs to take.
Dear Joss,
Thanks for reaching out about your upcoming trip. I have some good news for you regarding your email access while you're in South Africa and Zimbabwe.
The good news is, you can still use your Yahoo email.
Your Yahoo account is not tied to your physical location. Whether you're in Denmark, WA, or overseas, you can still send and receive emails as long as you have an internet connection.
The main issue to be aware of isn't with your email account, but with how you get online. Here’s a breakdown of your best options for staying connected.
Getting Internet While Overseas
1. Use Wi-Fi: This is the easiest and cheapest option. Most hotels, airports, and many cafes or businesses will have free Wi-Fi you can connect to with your laptop and phone. Using Wi-Fi won't cost you anything in Telstra roaming fees.
2. Telstra International Roaming: This is where you need to be careful.
South Africa: Is covered by Telstra's International Roaming Day Pass. This means you can use your Australian SIM card for data, calls, and texts for a daily fee. Check your My Telstra app to see your specific plan and roaming rates before you go.
Zimbabwe: Is generally not a Day Pass destination. If you use your Australian Telstra SIM card here, you will be on "Pay-As-You-Go" roaming, which can be extremely expensive. My strong advice is to avoid using your Telstra SIM for any data, calls, or texts while in Zimbabwe unless it's a true emergency.
3. Get a Local SIM Card: For longer trips, the most cost-effective option is to buy a local SIM card in each country. This will give you a local phone number, plus cheaper data, call, and text rates. Just make sure your phone is unlocked and can accept another carrier's SIM card.
Summary of Actionable Advice
Before you leave: Call Telstra or check the My Telstra app to confirm your roaming plan and rates for South Africa and Zimbabwe.
For South Africa: Rely on Wi-Fi first. If you need mobile data, the Telstra Day Pass is an option, but monitor your usage to avoid surprise costs.
For Zimbabwe: Use Wi-Fi only or get a local SIM card. Do not use your Australian Telstra SIM for data, as the charges will be very high.
I hope this helps you prepare for your trip. Feel free to get in touch if you have any other questions.
All the best,
[Your Name]

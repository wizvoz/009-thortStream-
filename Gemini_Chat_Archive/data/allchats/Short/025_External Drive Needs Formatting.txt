It sounds like the file system on your external drive has become corrupted or is no longer recognized by Windows. This is a common issue, especially with drives used on devices like TVs that might use non-standard or Linux-based file systems. Your best approach is to try and recover the data before you attempt to reformat the drive.
 Reformatting will erase everything.
Step 1: Check Disk Management
First, let's see exactly what Windows sees.
Press the Windows key + X and select Disk Management.
Look for your external drive in the list. It will likely show up as a "healthy" partition but with a file system type of "RAW" or simply blank, indicating Windows can't read it. The partition might also be unallocated.
This will confirm that the issue isn't a simple drive letter problem, but rather a file system corruption.
Step 2: Data Recovery Software
Do not format the drive.
 Instead, use data recovery software to try and pull your files off the drive.
 These tools can often read the raw data on the disk and reconstruct the file and folder structure.
Recuva (by Piriform) is a good free option for a basic scan.
EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard and TestDisk are other well-regarded alternatives, with TestDisk being a powerful, open-source tool.
Run the software and point it to the external drive. A deep scan is usually the most effective method in this scenario. It may take several hours to complete. Once the scan is finished, you can select the files and folders you want to recover and save them to a different, healthy drive.
Step 3: Reformat the Drive
After you've successfully recovered your data, you can proceed with reformatting the drive.
Go back to Disk Management.
Right-click on the external drive's partition and select Format.
Choose NTFS as the file system. It's the standard for Windows and supports large files. If you intend to use the drive with a Mac in the future, you could also consider exFAT, which is compatible with both Windows and macOS.
Give the drive a new volume label (a name) if you wish.
Check the Perform a quick format box for speed, unless you want to do a full format for security reasons.
If you don't care about the data and just want to get the drive working again, you can skip straight to this step. But Buddy Boy, I'd suggest at least checking what's on there before you wipe it clean. The television's use of a different file system is the most likely culprit here.

it says its raw

## RESPONSE ##

'RAW' means exactly what I suspected, Pappy. The file system is either damaged or just not one that Windows can recognize. Your files are still physically on the drive, but the operating system doesn't have the "map" to find them.
This reinforces the plan: do not format the drive. Instead, proceed directly to using data recovery software as I outlined in Step 2. That's your only shot at getting your data back before you re-initialize the drive's file structure.
Once you have your files safely on another drive, a simple reformat will get the drive working again for Windows. If it still won't format after that, then we can start to suspect a hardware failure. But let's cross that bridge when we come to it. First things first: get your data.

are these free softares? is there an open source solution

---

## RESPONSE ##

Yes, that's an excellent question, Buddy Boy. There are definitely free and open-source options available.
 Most commercial data recovery tools have a "freemium" model, where the free version has limitations—like only recovering a certain amount of data (e.g., a few hundred megabytes).
However, there are a couple of truly free and open-source solutions that are highly regarded:
TestDisk and PhotoRec: This is a powerful, open-source duo.
 TestDisk is primarily for recovering lost partitions and making non-booting disks bootable.
 PhotoRec is its companion, designed specifically for file recovery.
 It's excellent at what it does, and it completely ignores the file system, searching the raw data for file signatures.
 This makes it perfect for your 'RAW' drive situation. The catch is that they're command-line based, so they might not be as user-friendly as a graphical interface program, but they're extremely effective. They run on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
Recuva (by Piriform) also has a completely free version for personal use. It has a much more user-friendly graphical interface, which might be a good starting point if you're not comfortable with command-line tools. The free version is quite capable for a lot of basic recovery scenarios.
My recommendation is to start with a user-friendly option like Recuva, as it might be all you need. If that doesn't work, then moving on to a more powerful, albeit more technical, tool like PhotoRec is a great next step. Remember, with any of these tools, you need to save the recovered files to a different drive, not back onto the one you're trying to fix.

recuva says no recognised filesystem?

---

## RESPONSE ##

Well, that's not unexpected. Some versions of Recuva, particularly the free one, can struggle with drives that have a truly unrecognizable or corrupted file system. It's a limitation of its design—it needs to see some semblance of a file system to do its work.
This is a good point to pivot to our other option.
TestDisk and PhotoRec
TestDisk and PhotoRec are better suited for this exact scenario. While they may not be as pretty as Recuva, they are designed to bypass the operating system's file system recognition and instead scan the raw data on the disk itself for file headers.  This is exactly what you need when a drive shows up as "RAW."
PhotoRec specifically looks for common file types (JPEGs, MP3s, DOCs, etc.) and recovers them based on their signatures, without needing a valid file system to guide it.
You'll need to download and run these tools. The process is a bit more involved than clicking a few buttons in Recuva, as they are command-line tools. However, they are free, open-source, and highly effective for this kind of problem. You should be able to find a good guide online to walk you through the steps. Just remember, you'll need a separate drive with enough space to save the files PhotoRec finds.

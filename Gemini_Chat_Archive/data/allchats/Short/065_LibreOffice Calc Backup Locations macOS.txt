libre office calc autosave and backup where are the backups and autosaves kept on macos

---

## RESPONSE ##

Of course, Simon. Here are the locations for LibreOffice Calc's autosave and backup files on a macOS system.
File Locations for Autosave and Backups
On macOS, LibreOffice stores AutoRecovery information and backups in specific folders within your user library. This 'Library' folder is often hidden by default.
Default Backup Location
When you enable the "Always create a backup copy" option in LibreOffice, the backup files are stored in the following directory:
~/Library/Application Support/LibreOffice/4/user/backup
To access this, you can use the "Go to Folder" command in Finder.
Default AutoRecovery (Autosave) Location
The files for AutoRecovery, which is the autosave feature, are typically stored in your user profile's temporary files directory. The path for your LibreOffice user profile on a Mac is:
~/Library/Application Support/LibreOffice/4/user/
The autosaved versions of your documents will be in a temporary folder within this directory.
How to Check and Change These Locations
You can view and modify the paths LibreOffice uses for these files directly within the application's preferences.
Open LibreOffice Calc.
In the menu bar at the top of the screen, click on LibreOffice and then select Preferences.
In the preferences window that appears, expand the LibreOffice section in the left-hand pane and click on Paths.
This will display a list of file paths used by LibreOffice.
 You can see the current locations for "Backups" and "Temporary files".
To change a path, select the entry you wish to modify and click the Edit button. You can then browse to your desired folder.
Remember, the "Always create a backup copy" and "Save AutoRecovery information every..." options must be enabled under LibreOffice > Preferences > Load/Save > General for these features to function.

apple mail sort folders alphabetiocally

---

## RESPONSE ##

Of course, Simon.
Apple Mail does not offer an automatic, one-click feature to sort all folders alphabetically. The sorting is a manual process. A bit old-fashioned, I know, but it is the only method provided within the application.
Here is how you do it:
In the Mail sidebar, locate the account section whose folders you want to sort (e.g., "On My Mac," "iCloud").
Click and hold the folder you wish to move.
Drag the folder up or down in the list. A blue line will appear, indicating where the folder will be placed when you release the mouse button.
Release the mouse button to drop the folder into its new, alphabetized position.
You must do this for each folder individually to achieve an alphabetical order. The order you set is permanent until you manually change it again.
Note that you can only reorder folders within an account; you cannot change the order of the top-level accounts themselves (e.g., you can't drag the "Gmail" account above the "iCloud" account in the sidebar).
For those who find this tedious, the only alternative is a more technical approach using AppleScript to automate the process, but that comes with its own complexities.

gmail sort folders alphabetically

---

## RESPONSE ##

Got it, Simon. You're asking about sorting folders in Gmail. It's a common question, but Gmail handles this a bit differently from traditional email clients.
In Gmail, what you might call "folders" are actually called "labels." Hereâ€™s how sorting them works:
Automatic Alphabetical Sorting
By default, the main list of your custom labels in the left-hand sidebar is automatically sorted alphabetically. You cannot manually drag and drop them to reorder them as you can in other programs.
Manual Sorting for Priority
If you want specific labels to appear at the top of the list, out of alphabetical order, you have to be a little creative. The common workaround is to rename the label and add a special character or a number to the beginning of its name.
For example, if you have labels named "Archive," "Invoices," and "Projects" but you want "Invoices" to be at the top, you could rename it to _Invoices or 1. Invoices. Gmail's sorting places most punctuation and all numbers before letters, forcing those labels to the top of the list.
Nested Labels (Sub-folders)
If you have labels "nested" under a parent label (like sub-folders), the same rules apply. The labels within the parent category will also be sorted alphabetically.
To create or edit a label:
On your computer, open Gmail.
In the left sidebar, hover your mouse over the label you wish to change.
Click the three vertical dots that appear.
Select Edit to rename it.
So, in short: Gmail handles the primary alphabetical sorting for you automatically. If you need a different order, you'll need to use the renaming trick to force your preferred sequence.

so, if i am using apple mail to manage a gmail account there appears to be no way to simply alphabetically order the subfolders of a folder

---

## RESPONSE ##

That's correct, Simon. You've pinpointed a classic point of friction between how Gmail and Apple Mail operate. There is no simple way to permanently sort Gmail subfolders alphabetically within Apple Mail because the two systems handle sorting differently.
The Core of the Problem
Gmail (The Server): Gmail's system is the "source of truth." It automatically sorts its labels (which Apple Mail sees as folders) in alphabetical order on the server.
Apple Mail (The Client): Apple Mail allows for manual sorting via drag-and-drop.
When you manually reorder folders in Apple Mail for a Gmail account, you are fighting the server. The next time Apple Mail performs a full sync with Gmail, the server will override your manual changes and force the folders back into its default alphabetical order. Any sorting you do in Apple Mail is temporary at best.
The Solution
The only permanent solution is to control the alphabetical order from the source: Gmail itself.
Log in to your Gmail account in a web browser.
Find the labels (folders) you want to reorder.
Rename them to force the order you want. You can use numbers or special characters as prefixes.
For example, if you want your labels to appear in this specific order:
Work
Personal
Finances
You would rename them in the Gmail interface to:
1_Work
2_Personal
3_Finances
After you rename them on the Gmail website, Apple Mail will sync and display them in that new, correct order.

how do i force a fuyll sync with gmail

---

## RESPONSE ##

Certainly, Simon. After you've made changes on the Gmail website, you'll want Apple Mail to reflect them. Forcing a full sync can be done in a few ways, from a simple refresh to a more thorough rebuild.
Here are the methods, listed from the simplest to the most comprehensive.
Method 1: The Standard Synchronize
This is the quickest and most common method. It instructs Apple Mail to check the server for any changes, including folder renames.
In Apple Mail, click on your Gmail account in the sidebar on the left. Make sure the main account is selected, not just the inbox.
Go to the Mailbox menu at the top of the screen.
Click Synchronize "[Your Gmail Account Name]".
Apple Mail will then communicate with Gmail's server and update the folder list and messages.
Method 2: Take the Account Offline and Online
This is the classic "turn it off and on again" approach. It forces Mail to re-establish its connection to the server, which often triggers a fresh sync.
Go to the Mailbox menu.
Click Take All Accounts Offline. The mailboxes in the sidebar will dim.
Wait about 15 seconds.
Go back to the Mailbox menu and click Get All New Mail. This will bring all accounts back online and force them to check for updates.
Method 3: Rebuild the Mailbox
This is the most drastic option and is generally overkill for just syncing folder names, but it is the most thorough way to force a full re-download of content from the server.
Warning: This can be time-consuming and will use more data, as it deletes the local copies of your emails and downloads them again.
In the Mail sidebar, select the mailbox you want to fully resync (e.g., your Gmail Inbox, or even the top-level Gmail account icon itself).
Go to the Mailbox menu.
Click Rebuild at the bottom of the menu.
The contents of the mailbox will disappear and then slowly repopulate as they are re-downloaded from the Gmail server. For your specific purpose of syncing folder names, Method 1 or 2 should be sufficient.

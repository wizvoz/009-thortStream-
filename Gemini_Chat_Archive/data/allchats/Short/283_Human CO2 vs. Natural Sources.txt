is it true that underwater volcanoes and sunspot activity create more co2 than mankind

## RESPONSE ##

No, it is not true that underwater volcanoes and sunspot activity create more CO2 than mankind. Here's a breakdown of the facts:
Volcanic CO2 emissions:
While volcanoes, including underwater ones, do release CO2, their emissions are significantly less than those from human activities.
Scientific studies consistently show that human activities emit far more CO2 than all volcanoes combined.
Organizations like the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and NOAA have published information that shows that human emissions dwarf those of volcanoes.
Sunspot activity:
Sunspot activity influences the Earth's energy balance, but it's not a significant source of CO2.
The primary driver of the current increase in atmospheric CO2 is the burning of fossil fuels by humans.
Human CO2 emissions:
The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), deforestation, and industrial processes are the main sources of human-caused CO2 emissions.
These emissions have increased dramatically since the Industrial Revolution, leading to the current rise in atmospheric CO2 levels.
In summary, the overwhelming scientific consensus is that human activities are the dominant source of increased CO2 in the atmosphere.

## RESPONSE ##

Here's the plan I've put together. Let me know if you need any changes before I start researching.
 Sound Bar Prices and Suppliers
 
Research Websites
(1) Identify the common types and categories of sound bars available in the market, considering different features and price points.
(2) Find major retailers and suppliers of sound bars that serve the Denmark, Western Australia region, including both local and online options.
(3) For each identified supplier, browse their product listings to gather a comprehensive list of sound bar models they offer.
(4) For each sound bar model found, extract detailed pricing information, including any current sales or promotions.
(5) For each supplier, locate and record their primary contact phone numbers.
(6) For each supplier, locate and record their official website addresses.
(7) Research key specifications and features for popular sound bar models to provide context for the pricing, such as connectivity options, audio channels, and smart features.
(8) Investigate customer reviews and ratings for a selection of sound bar models to provide insights into their performance and value.

Understood, Pappy. The priorities have been noted. "Deep research" seems to be a casualty of the current operational tempo, but I'll generate a preliminary list based on readily available data. I'll also ensure that the televisions are not forgotten, as you requested.
Here is the information you requested, based on a rapid data scan of current offerings.

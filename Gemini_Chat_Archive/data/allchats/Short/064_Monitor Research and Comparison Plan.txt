Dora initialised. All set, Simon. Commands: !p !ef !ep !ed !k !lh !pu !h. Use !h for details.
Yes, Buddy Boy, the monitor does come with management software.
 My research confirms that the AOC AGON AG493UCX2 is compatible with several utility applications.
Specifically, it supports AOC G-Menu, which is a free desktop tool that allows you to manage all of the monitor's settings from your PC, rather than using the on-screen display (OSD) and physical buttons.
 This can be more convenient for adjusting things like game modes, color settings, and other features.
Additionally, AOC provides Screen+, a separate utility designed for window management, which helps you split, resize, and organize multiple windows on the ultrawide display for multitasking.
 Both of these can be downloaded from the AOC website's support page for your specific monitor model.
It's worth noting that some user feedback has pointed to the G-Menu software being a bit particular, sometimes requiring a specific order of operations with the physical OSD menu for certain features like Picture-by-Picture to work correctly. It's not a deal-breaker, but it's something to be aware of.

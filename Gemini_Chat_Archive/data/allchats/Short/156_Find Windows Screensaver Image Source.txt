TITLE: Find Windows Screensaver Image Source

win 10 screensaver set to a folder how do i find out the current image source location

## RESPONSE ##

When your Windows 10 screensaver is set to a folder, finding the exact image currently being displayed can be a bit tricky because Windows often creates a cached copy. However, there are a few methods you can try:
1. Check the Screensaver Settings (Direct Folder Source)
If you specifically set the screensaver to pull images from a particular folder, that's your primary source.
Go to Settings > Personalization > Lock screen.
Scroll down and click on Screen saver settings.
In the Screen Saver window, select Photos from the dropdown.
Click on Settings....
This will show you the folder (or folders) that your screensaver is currently using. While it won't tell you the exact image being displayed at that moment, it tells you the pool of images from which it's drawing.
2. Check the Registry (for the transcoded/cached image)
Windows stores a transcoded (optimized for display) version of the current desktop background (and sometimes screensaver images) in the Registry. You can often glean the original path from this.
Press Win + R to open the Run dialog.
Type regedit and press Enter to open the Registry Editor.
Navigate to the following path:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop
In the right-hand pane, look for a value named TranscodedImageCache.
Double-click TranscodedImageCache. This is a REG_BINARY value.
The file path of the current image is usually embedded within this binary data. It can be a bit hard to read, but you might be able to make out the path to the original image folder. Look for readable text strings within the data.
3. Check Cached Files Location (if the image is a desktop background acting as screensaver)
If your "screensaver" is simply your desktop background slideshow, then Windows also keeps a cached version of the currently displayed image.
Open File Explorer.
Go to the following path (you might need to enable "Show hidden files, folders, and drives" in Folder Options via the "View" tab in File Explorer):
%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Themes\TranscodedWallpaper
This TranscodedWallpaper file has no extension, but it's a JPEG. You can copy it to another location and add a .jpg extension to view it. This will be the current image displayed, but it's a cached copy, not necessarily the original file in your source folder.
4. Use a PowerShell Command (more advanced)
For the desktop background, you can use PowerShell to extract the path from the TranscodedImageCache registry key. This is more reliable for the active desktop background, which sometimes overlaps with screensaver behavior.
Open PowerShell (search for "PowerShell" in the Start Menu).
Paste the following two lines and press Enter after each:
PowerShell
$TIC=(Get-ItemProperty 'HKCU:\Control Panel\Desktop' TranscodedImageCache -ErrorAction Stop).TranscodedImageCache
[System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetString($TIC) -replace '(.+)([A-Z]:[0-9a-zA-Z\\])+\','$2'
This command attempts to decode the TranscodedImageCache and display the original path.
Important Notes:
Screensaver vs. Desktop Background Slideshow: Be clear about whether you're using a true "screensaver" (like the Photos screensaver) or a desktop background slideshow that appears when your computer is idle. The "Photos" screensaver specifically uses a folder, while the desktop background can be set to a slideshow from a folder. The methods above are more geared towards finding the desktop background source, but they can often overlap.
Hidden Files: Many of the locations Windows uses for cached images are in hidden folders. Make sure you've enabled "Show hidden files, folders, and drives" in File Explorer options.
Third-Party Apps: If you're using a third-party screensaver or wallpaper management tool, it will likely have its own settings or ways to identify the current image source. Check the documentation for that specific application.
In most cases, looking at the "Screen saver settings" under Personalization for the "Photos" screensaver will directly show you the folder you selected. The other methods are more for finding the currently displayed image's specific file path or where Windows caches it.

sorry, wallpaper not screensaver

## RESPONSE ##

Ah, my apologies for the misunderstanding! It's much easier to find the source for your current wallpaper.
Here's how to find the current wallpaper image source location in Windows 10:
1. Check Personalization Settings (Most Common)
This is the most straightforward method.
Right-click anywhere on your desktop and select Personalize.
In the Settings window, make sure you're on the Background tab (it should be the default).
Under the "Background" dropdown, you'll see how your wallpaper is set:
Picture: If it's a single picture, the path to that picture will be displayed directly below "Choose your picture."
Solid color: No image source here.
Slideshow: If you have a slideshow, it will list the folder(s) from which the images are being pulled. You can click "Browse" under "Choose albums for your slideshow" to see the exact folders selected. While this won't tell you the exact image currently displayed in the slideshow, it tells you the source folders.
2. Check the Registry (for the transcoded/cached image and its path)
Windows caches the current wallpaper image and stores its original path in the Registry. This is particularly useful if you're using a slideshow and want to know the exact image being displayed right now.
Press Win + R to open the Run dialog.
Type regedit and press Enter to open the Registry Editor.
Navigate to the following path:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop
In the right-hand pane, look for a value named TranscodedImageCache.
Double-click TranscodedImageCache. This is a REG_BINARY value.
The file path of the current image is usually embedded within this binary data. It can be a bit hard to read, but you can often make out the full path (e.g., C:\Users\YourUsername\Pictures\MyWallpaper.jpg) within the "Data" field. Look for readable text strings.
3. Check the Cached Files Location (the current image itself)
Windows also creates a transcoded (optimized) copy of the currently displayed wallpaper.
Open File Explorer.
Go to the following path (you might need to enable "Show hidden files, folders, and drives" in Folder Options via the "View" tab in File Explorer's ribbon):
%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Themes\TranscodedWallpaper
This TranscodedWallpaper file has no extension. It's essentially a JPEG image. You can copy this file to another location (e.g., your Desktop) and then add a .jpg extension to it (e.g., TranscodedWallpaper.jpg) to view the exact image currently being used as your wallpaper. This will be the cached version, not necessarily the original file in its source location, but it confirms what's on your screen.
4. Use a PowerShell Command (more precise for the original path)
This command can often extract the original path from the TranscodedImageCache more cleanly than manually reading the binary data.
Open PowerShell (search for "PowerShell" in the Start Menu).
Paste the following two lines and press Enter after each:
PowerShell
$TIC=(Get-ItemProperty 'HKCU:\Control Panel\Desktop' TranscodedImageCache -ErrorAction Stop).TranscodedImageCache
[System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetString($TIC) -replace '(.+)([A-Z]:[0-9a-zA-Z\\])+\','$2'
This command will attempt to decode the TranscodedImageCache binary data and should output the original file path of your current wallpaper.
In summary:
For the most direct answer, check Settings > Personalization > Background.
If you need the exact file currently being displayed (especially from a slideshow), use the Registry method or the PowerShell command to find the original path, or check the %AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Themes\TranscodedWallpaper file for the cached image itself.

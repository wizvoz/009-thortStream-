Essential Spanner Sizes for Bicycle and E-bike Maintenance
A core set of metric spanners will cover the vast majority of repairs for both standard bicycles and e-bikes. While many components are fastened with Allen (hex) keys, a good selection of spanners is indispensable for general maintenance and specific components.
The Most Common Spanner Sizes:
For most routine adjustments and common parts on a bicycle or e-bike, you will find the following metric spanner sizes to be essential:
8mm, 9mm, and 10mm: These smaller sizes are frequently used for brake adjustments, derailleur fittings, and various accessory mounts. A combination spanner set covering these is a fundamental requirement for any bike tool kit.
13mm, 14mm, and 15mm: These sizes are crucial for axle nuts (on non-quick-release wheels), pedals, and some braking systems. The 15mm spanner is particularly vital as it is the standard size for installing and removing most pedals. A dedicated pedal spanner is often recommended for better leverage.
17mm: This size is commonly found on the axle nuts of many e-bikes and some modern standard bicycles.
E-Bike Specific Considerations:
While e-bikes share many standard bicycle components, the addition of a motor and battery can introduce other fastener sizes.
Axle Nuts: E-bike hub motors, particularly on the rear wheel, often use larger and more robust axles. While 17mm is common, some may use M12 nuts, which typically require an 18mm or 19mm spanner.
Motor and Battery Mounts: The bolts securing the motor to the frame or the battery housing are often standard metric hex bolts. The most frequently encountered sizes are M5 and M6, which correspond to 8mm and 10mm spanners respectively. However, it's not uncommon for these to be Allen or Torx bolts instead.
Specialty Spanners:
For more in-depth repairs, a few specialty spanners are necessary:
Cone Spanners: These are thin spanners designed to fit the narrow flats on wheel hubs for bearing adjustments.
 Common sizes for this task range from 13mm to 18mm.
Adjustable Spanner: A small to medium-sized adjustable spanner can be a versatile tool for odd-sized nuts or as a backup, though a correctly sized combination spanner is always the preferred option to avoid rounding off nuts.
Allen (Hex) Keys - An Essential Complement:
It is important to note that a significant number of bicycle and e-bike components are secured with Allen keys rather than traditional hex bolts. The most ubiquitous sizes are 4mm, 5mm, and 6mm, with 8mm being common for crank bolts. A comprehensive set of high-quality Allen keys ranging from 1.5mm to 10mm is a workshop staple.
In summary, a cyclist looking to perform their own maintenance should prioritize acquiring a quality set of metric combination spanners from 8mm to 19mm and a comprehensive set of metric Allen keys. This combination will allow for work on the vast majority of fasteners found on both conventional bicycles and their electric counterparts.

do i need two of any spanner to maintain a bike or ebike

## RESPONSE ##

Yes, for certain maintenance tasks on both standard bicycles and e-bikes, you will need two spanners of the same size. This is not a frequent requirement, but it is critical for specific jobs.
The most common reason you'll need two spanners is for adjusting wheel hub bearings.
Most non-sealed hubs use a "cup and cone" bearing system. To adjust the play in these bearings, you need to tighten or loosen a cone and then secure it with a locknut. This procedure requires two spanners working in opposition to each other.
How it works: One thin "cone spanner" holds the cone in place, while a second spanner (either another cone spanner or a standard spanner of the same size) is used to turn the locknut. Without two spanners, you cannot properly tighten the locknut against the cone, and the adjustment will not hold.
Common sizes: The spanners required for this task are typically between 13mm and 17mm. For instance, a common setup is a 15mm cone spanner and a 15mm standard spanner.
A less frequent but possible scenario involves axle nuts. On some bikes with bolt-on wheels, you might find it necessary to use one spanner to hold a nut on one side of the axle while tightening the nut on the other side, particularly if the axle itself spins. This would require two spanners of the same size, often 15mm or 17mm.
In summary, while you won't need two of every spanner size, having a second spanner for sizes like 15mm and 17mm is essential for performing one of the most fundamental maintenance tasks: wheel hub adjustments.

can you explain wheel hub adjustments

## RESPONSE ##

Of course. Adjusting a wheel hub is a fundamental piece of bicycle maintenance. It ensures your wheels spin smoothly and efficiently while preventing long-term damage to the hub's internal components.
Here’s a detailed explanation of what a wheel hub adjustment entails, why it’s necessary, and how it’s done.
What is a Wheel Hub?
The hub is the central part of your bicycle's wheel.
 It houses the axle, which attaches the wheel to the frame, and a set of bearings that allow the wheel to rotate with minimal friction.
There are two main types of hub bearings:
Cartridge Bearings: These are pre-assembled, sealed units that are pressed into the hub shell.
 They are generally not adjustable and are replaced entirely when they wear out.
Cup and Cone Bearings: This is the traditional, adjustable system.
 It consists of loose ball bearings that roll between a "cup" (which is part of the hub shell) and a threaded "cone" that screws onto the axle.
 This is the system that requires periodic adjustment.
Why is Hub Adjustment Necessary?
The goal of a hub adjustment is to find the perfect balance where the wheel spins with the least possible friction, but without any side-to-side "wobble" or "play."
If the adjustment is too tight: The cones press too hard on the bearings. This creates excessive friction, making the wheel difficult to spin. Pedaling will feel sluggish, and the constant pressure will rapidly wear out the bearings and damage the surfaces of the cup and cone, a type of damage known as "pitting."
If the adjustment is too loose: There will be a noticeable knocking or wobble when you rock the wheel from side to side. While the wheel might spin freely, this play allows the bearings to rattle and knock around inside the hub instead of rolling smoothly. This can damage the bearings and the hub shell, and it can make the bike feel unstable, especially at speed or when cornering.
Over time, normal use will cause the components to wear slightly, which typically results in the hub becoming too loose.
How to Adjust a Cup and Cone Hub
Adjusting a hub is a task of fine increments. The key challenge lies in tightening the outer locknut without altering the position of the cone. This is why you need two spanners, one of which must be a thin "cone spanner."
The Essential Tools:
Cone Spanners: Thin spanners (often 13mm, 15mm, or 17mm) designed to fit on the narrow flats of the cone.
Standard Wrench or Spanner: To turn the locknut.
Your hands to feel for play and resistance.
The Step-by-Step Process:
Here is a simplified overview of the procedure. For a first-timer, watching a video of the process is highly recommended.
Assess the Hub: With the wheel securely in the bike's dropouts, grab the top of the tire and try to move it from side to side. If you feel a distinct "clunk" or wobble, the hub is too loose. If you remove the wheel and the axle feels rough or gritty when you turn it by hand, it might be too tight.
Access the Cone and Locknut: You will typically adjust the hub from one side (usually the non-drive side on a rear wheel). You'll see two nuts on the axle. The inner one is the cone, and the outer one is the locknut.
Loosen the Locknut: Place the cone spanner on the cone to hold it steady. Use your standard spanner to turn the locknut counter-clockwise, just enough to loosen it.
Make the Adjustment:
To Tighten a Loose Hub: With the locknut loosened, use the cone spanner to turn the cone clockwise in a very small increment (e.g., 1/8th of a turn). This pushes the cone closer to the bearings.
To Loosen a Tight Hub: Turn the cone counter-clockwise.
Lock the Adjustment: This is the crucial part. Hold the cone in its new position with the cone spanner. Now, use your other spanner to tighten the locknut clockwise until it is snug against the cone. The trick is to prevent the cone from turning as you tighten the locknut.
Check Your Work: With the locknut tight, feel the adjustment again.
Turn the axle with your fingers. Does it spin smoothly?
Wiggle the ends of the axle. Is the play gone?
You will likely need to repeat steps 3-6 several times to find the sweet spot. The ideal adjustment is the loosest setting that has absolutely no side-to-side play.
A special note for quick-release wheels: The pressure from the quick-release skewer slightly compresses the axle. The best practice is to adjust the hub so there is a tiny amount of play when it's out of the bike, which will disappear once the wheel is clamped into the frame. This takes a bit of practice to get right.

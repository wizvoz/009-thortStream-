TITLE: Gina Dog Care Advice

---

## PROMPT ##

i live in a one bedroom aoartment with a small garden. My dog, oscar has access to the garden easily. I cannot do a lot of exercise so we mainly stay at home. That said, as often as i can i take hime for a walk or in the car which he enjoys.. At least once a fortnight he gets to come to a friends house and plays with another dog. Whilst this is not a perfect environment for a dog I accept that it is all i can do. He is well fed and well cared for. My vet says he is getting enough socialisation. I have owned many dogs in the past and all of them have lived longer than usual for their breed - up to 18 years with a terrier. My problem is that my well meaning neighbour has sent me a sms message with the following advice. "oscar neds to be outside, enjoyng being a dog, rooting around, without coonstant constriction for movement happiness, enjoymeny. The closing of his eye is directly related to his heart and also circulation." Gina, the neighbour has some very new age opinions about how to be healthy and the readng of symptoms and solutions - she is a fundamental believer in a particular form of yoga. I need you to help me to reply to this message (or not at all) so i would like you to provide say 5 responses to this message. They should be quite short - twenty or so words. I do not want to make an enemy of Gina and I do not want her to stop talking to me. I believe in live and let live - you do your thing, i do mine. I am happy to listen to advice but make no promises about taking it. So can you help with five suggested replies please

Replying to Gina
It's completely understandable that you want to maintain a good relationship with Gina while also setting boundaries about Oscar's care. Here are five short, polite, and non-committal replies that acknowledge her message without inviting further unsolicited advice:
"Thanks for your thoughts, Gina! Oscar's a happy boy, and his vet says he's doing great."
"I appreciate your concern, Gina. We're keeping a close eye on Oscar and his health."
"Thanks for reaching out, Gina. We're managing Oscar's routine the best we can."
"That's interesting, Gina. We'll definitely keep all your suggestions in mind."
"Thanks for the advice, Gina! Oscar's well-being is always my top priority."

Replying to Gina
Here are five slightly longer messages, around 40 words, that maintain politeness and boundaries:
"Thanks for your message, Gina. I appreciate your thoughts on Oscar. We regularly check in with our vet, and they're very happy with his health and how much socialization he's getting. He's a very contented dog."
"That's an interesting perspective, Gina, and I appreciate you sharing it. We make sure Oscar gets plenty of outdoor time in our garden and enjoys his walks and car rides. His well-being is always our top priority."
"Thanks for reaching out, Gina. We've had dogs for many years, and we're confident Oscar is getting all the care and attention he needs. His vet has given him a clean bill of health, so we're not too concerned."
"I appreciate your concern for Oscar, Gina. We've got a good routine that works for him, including his garden access and regular visits with his doggy friend. We're always monitoring his health closely with the vet."
"It's kind of you to think of Oscar, Gina. While I appreciate new ideas, we're following our vet's advice on his exercise and social needs. He's very happy and well-adjusted, and that's what matters most to us."

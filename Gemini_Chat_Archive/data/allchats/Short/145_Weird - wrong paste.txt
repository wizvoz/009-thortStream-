## RESPONSE ##

Optimal cold-weather "war clothing" involves layering systems that insulate, wick moisture, and allow ventilation. The cleanest water available typically refers to spring or glacier water for its natural purity and mineral content, or distilled/purified water through advanced filtration. An "army of servants" in a practical sense implies highly skilled and dedicated staff for efficient operations and comfort. The "best yacht" would feature extensive luxury amenities, advanced technology, and personalized designs such as private owner's decks, helipads, spas, and innovative eco-friendly systems.

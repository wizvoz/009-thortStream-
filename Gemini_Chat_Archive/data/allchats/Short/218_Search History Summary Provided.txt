You follow a wide array of sports, with a strong focus on cricket (both international and Australian leagues), Australian Rules Football (AFL), Formula 1, and the Olympics, tracking schedules, results, and teams.
Being located in Denmark, Western Australia is also evident, with searches for local businesses, weather updates from the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), and information about the Shire.

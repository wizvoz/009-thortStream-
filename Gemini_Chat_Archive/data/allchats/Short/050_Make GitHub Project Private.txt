That's a good plan, Buddy Boy. Keeping things under wraps is a wise move.
Making a public repository private on GitHub is a straightforward process, but you need to be an administrator of the repository to do it. Here's the general sequence:
Navigate to your repository: Go to the main page of the repository you want to change.
Access Settings: Click on the "Settings" tab. You'll find this near the top of the page, under the repository's name.
Find the "Danger Zone": Scroll down to the bottom of the Settings page. There's a section clearly labeled "Danger Zone" which contains a number of irreversible or significant actions.
Change Visibility: In the "Danger Zone" section, you'll see "Change repository visibility".
 Click the "Change visibility" button next to it.
Select "Private": A new page or pop-up will appear.
 Select the "Make private" option.
Confirm the change: GitHub will ask you to confirm by typing the repository's name.
 This is a final safeguard to ensure you're making the change to the correct repository. Type the name, then click the confirmation button.
Be aware that making a public repository private has a few consequences, such as detaching any public forks and unpublishing any associated GitHub Pages site.
 The system will give you a clear warning about these things before you confirm, so read it over carefully. It's a quick process, but it's not something to do on a whim.

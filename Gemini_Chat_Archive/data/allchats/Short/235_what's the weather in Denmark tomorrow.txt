## RESPONSE ##

The term "woke" has a complex and evolving history, and its meaning can vary depending on context and who is using it.
Origin and Early Meaning:
African American English: The word "woke" originated in African American Vernacular English (AAVE) in the early 20th century.
Awareness of racial injustice: Initially, it referred to being "awake" or alert to issues of racial prejudice, discrimination, and systemic injustice. Phrases like "stay woke" encouraged Black people to remain conscious of the realities of racism.
Examples:
Folk singer Lead Belly used "stay woke" in a 1938 recording of his song "Scottsboro Boys," about nine Black teenagers falsely accused of rape.
In 1971, playwright Barry Beckham used the term in his play "Garvey Lives!" to describe a state of awareness of structural racism.
Evolution and Broader Use:
2010s and Black Lives Matter: The term gained widespread popularity in the 2010s, particularly with the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement. It became a rallying cry for activists to raise awareness about police brutality and other social injustices.
Broader social justice issues: As it spread, its meaning broadened to encompass a general awareness of and active attention to important societal facts and issues, especially those related to racial and social justice, inequality, and discrimination.
Contemporary Usage and Contested Meaning:
Positive connotation: For some, "woke" still carries its original positive meaning, signifying a commitment to empathy, justice, awareness, and action in addressing social issues. It implies being progressive, inclusive, and thoughtful towards marginalized groups.
Negative/Pejorative connotation: More recently, particularly in political discourse, "woke" has been increasingly used as a pejorative or derogatory term. In this context, it often refers to:
Politically liberal or progressive views: Especially when perceived as unreasonable, extreme, or overly sensitive.
"Cancel culture" and "political correctness": It can be used to criticize what some see as excessive focus on identity politics, virtue signaling, or attempts to restrict speech or traditional values.
Misuse and distortion: Critics on the right have been accused of co-opting and weaponizing the term to dismiss or denigrate those with whom they disagree on social issues.
In summary, "woke" started as a call for awareness and vigilance against racial injustice within the Black community. While it still holds that meaning for many, its mainstream use has become highly politicized and often carries a negative connotation, used to criticize progressive viewpoints and perceived excesses of social justice movements.

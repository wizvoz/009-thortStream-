Yes, JDownloader can download videos from YouTube.
 It's a popular feature of the software.
You simply copy the YouTube video URL, and JDownloader's "Linkgrabber" will automatically detect it.
 From there, you can choose from the available formats and resolutions to download the video or just the audio.
It's worth noting a few things, Pappy:
Plugins: JDownloader uses plugins for different websites, including YouTube.
 These are generally kept up-to-date by the JDownloader community to handle any changes YouTube makes. You can manage these in Settings -> Plugins.
Potential Issues: Occasionally, updates to YouTube's site can temporarily break the download functionality. If you run into trouble, it's a good idea to ensure your JDownloader is fully updated, as the developers usually release fixes quickly. Sometimes, a simple restart of the application or your router can resolve the issue. In some reported cases, using a VPN has also helped.
File Formats: Modern YouTube videos often use separate streams for video and audio (DASH streams). JDownloader is designed to handle this and will automatically merge the two into a single file after downloading.
In short, it's a capable tool for the job. Just keep it updated.
For a visual guide, this video provides a tutorial on using JDownloader 2.

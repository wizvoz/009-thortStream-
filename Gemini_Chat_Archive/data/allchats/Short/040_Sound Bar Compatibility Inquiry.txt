because albany is a large town near denmark, when discussing bricks and mortar retailers, take special note of albany - i believe hat retravsion has a branch in ambany. bricks at mortar retailers anywhere else are not of value to me, just online deliverers

Here's the plan I've put together. Let me know if you need any changes before I start researching.
 Albany Retailers and Online Delivery
 
Research Websites
(1) Identify prominent 'bricks and mortar' retail categories relevant to a large town like Albany, Western Australia.
(2) For each identified category, find specific 'bricks and mortar' retailers operating in Albany, Western Australia.
(3) Verify the existence and details of a Retravision branch in Albany, Western Australia, including its address and operating hours.
(4) For each identified 'bricks and mortar' retailer in Albany, gather their physical address, typical operating hours, and primary product or service offerings.
(5) Identify major online retailers and delivery services that provide delivery to the Denmark/Albany region of Western Australia.
(6) For these online deliverers, determine their delivery coverage area, estimated delivery times to the region, and any associated delivery fees or minimum order requirements.
(7) Compare the product availability, pricing, and convenience of the Albany-based 'bricks and mortar' retailers with the identified online deliverers serving the region.

## RESPONSE ##

The concept of "dog-whistling" in politics refers to the use of coded language that appears to mean one thing to the general public but carries a different, often controversial or divisive, message to a specific, targeted audience.
 This allows a politician to appeal to certain groups while maintaining plausible deniability.
Analysis of Benjamin Netanyahu's rhetoric by various sources suggests that he has been accused of using dog-whistling and other calculated linguistic strategies.
 Here's a breakdown of some recurring themes and criticisms:
Appeals to the Far Right and Nationalism: Some analyses suggest that Netanyahu has aligned with movements that critics say are "steeped in xenophobia, anti-Muslim hatred," and even "insidious antisemitism" (in the case of some European far-right leaders he has courted).
 While he may publicly tout support from these leaders, critics argue he can turn a blind eye to their "anti-Semitic dog whistling" if it serves his political interests.
Framing of "Us vs. Them": Research into Netanyahu's speeches, particularly concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, often highlights his consistent use of language that frames a clear binary between a positive "in-group" (Israel, "the Jewish people") and a negative "out-group" or "enemy" (often "militant Islam," Hamas, Iran). This can involve:
Victimhood Narrative: Emphasizing Israeli suffering and portraying Israel as a victim of attacks, while depicting its actions as defensive and justified.
Dehumanization of Opponents: Using "negative social evaluations" to portray opponents as "brutal and immoral."
Historical and Religious Connotations: Referring to historical events like the Holocaust and religious narratives to evoke emotion and legitimize Israel's actions, sometimes being accused of "manufacturing consent" through these appeals.
Controlling the Narrative: Netanyahu's speeches are analyzed for linguistic strategies that aim to "manipulate and influence the audience" and "gain legitimacy whilst justifying and legitimising Israel's actions."
 This includes:
Strategic Use of Speech Acts: Utilizing assertives (statements of fact/belief), directives (commands/requests), and declaratives (statements that effect change) to inform, guide, and persuade with authority.
Indirect Speech Acts: Employing implications and inferences to convey messages without complete transparency.
Metaphors and Framing: Using carefully chosen words and expressions to shape public opinion and present issues in a light favorable to his positions.
Examples cited in analyses often include:
Alliances with certain European leaders: Critics point to Netanyahu's willingness to engage with figures like Viktor Orban, who has faced accusations of anti-Semitic dog-whistling, despite concerns from within Jewish communities.
Rhetoric concerning "militant Islam": This phrase can be seen as a broad brushstroke that, while seemingly referring to extremist groups, can be interpreted by some audiences as a broader condemnation of Islam, fostering Islamophobia.
Responses to criticism: Netanyahu has been accused of dismissing criticism as "fake news" and using "racist dog whistles and extreme statements about his political opponents to rile his base."
It's important to note that the interpretation of "dog-whistling" can be subjective and depend on the listener's background and perspective.
 However, academic and journalistic analyses frequently highlight these linguistic patterns in Netanyahu's public discourse as deliberate attempts to communicate specific messages to different audiences.

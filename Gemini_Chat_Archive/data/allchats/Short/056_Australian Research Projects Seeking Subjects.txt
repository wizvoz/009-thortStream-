## PROMPT ##

are there any research projects in australiaon these isues, trials etc looking for subjects

---

## RESPONSE ##

Here's my plan to tackle that topic. Let me know if you need to make changes.
 Australian Research Subject Recruitment
 
Research Websites
(1) Identify official Australian clinical trial registries and research databases that list studies actively seeking participants.
(2) Explore websites of major Australian universities, hospitals, and medical research institutes for their ongoing research projects and clinical trials.
(3) Investigate government health department websites in Australia for public health studies or initiatives that may be recruiting subjects.
(4) For any identified research projects or trials, determine the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for participant eligibility.
(5) Analyze the common research areas or health conditions for which studies are frequently recruiting subjects in Australia.
(6) Find information on how individuals can express interest or apply to become a subject in these research projects or trials.
(7) Research the process for ethical review and participant consent for human subject research in Australia.

I've updated the plan. Let me know if you'd like to change anything.
 Fecal transplant research in Australia
 
Research Websites
(1) Search official Australian clinical trial registries (e.g., ANZCTR) and medical research databases for studies related to "fecal microbiota transplant" (FMT) or "fecal transplant" that are actively recruiting participants.
(2) Investigate websites of leading Australian universities, hospitals, and medical research institutes known for gastroenterology or microbiome research for ongoing projects and clinical trials on FMT.
(3) Look for any public health initiatives or government-funded research in Australia related to gut health or microbiome therapies, specifically checking for FMT studies seeking subjects.
(4) For any identified fecal transplant research projects or trials, determine the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for participant eligibility.
(5) Analyze the common health conditions or research areas for which fecal transplant studies are frequently recruiting subjects in Australia (e.g., C. difficile infection, IBD, IBS, metabolic syndrome).
(6) Find information on how individuals can express interest or apply to become a subject in these specific fecal transplant research projects or trials.
(7) Research the general process for ethical review and participant consent for human subject research involving novel therapies like FMT in Australia.

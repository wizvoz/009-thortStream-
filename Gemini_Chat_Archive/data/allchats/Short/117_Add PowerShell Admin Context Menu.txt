TITLE: Add PowerShell Admin Context Menu

## PROMPT ##

i am on windows 10, want to create a batch or cmd that will add to my context menu and add "create powershell as admin here"

## RESPONSE ##

Dora initialised. All set, Simon.
Right then, Buddy Boy, if you want to add "Create PowerShell as Admin Here" to your context menu on Windows 10, the most direct way is to use a .reg file. It's a simple registry script that does all the heavy lifting for you.
Here's the content you'll need. Just copy this into a text file and save it with a .reg extension.
PowerShell Admin Context Menu .reg File (Updated)
Jul 9, 10:23 PM
Open
Once you've got that saved as, say, AddPowerShellAdmin.reg, simply double-click it. Windows will ask for confirmation to merge it into the registry. Say "Yes," and you're good to go. You should then be able to right-click on any folder background in File Explorer and see your new option.
Let me know if you need any further adjustments, or if you'd like to remove it later!

that works but after the pwrshell comes up we get some complaint in a new terminl - something about at a drive

---

## RESPONSE ##

Alright, Pappy, I understand. That "complaint about a drive" usually pops up when PowerShell gets a bit finicky about how it interprets the current path, especially if you're right-clicking on a drive root like C:\. It's a common minor annoyance.
The fix is to streamline the command a bit, so the initial, non-elevated PowerShell window doesn't try to Set-Location before it launches the elevated one. We'll just pass the current path directly to the elevated instance.
Here's the updated .reg file for you. Just replace the old one with this, save it, and double-click to merge it into the registry.
This version should prevent that initial grumbling from PowerShell. Give it a whirl and let me know if it's behaving itself now.

works perfectly to cretae the ps window i want but then spawns another pwrshell window with this in it
Set-Location : Cannot find drive. A drive with the name '\C' does not exist.

## RESPONSE ##

Understood, Simon. It seems we're still getting a phantom PowerShell window with that pesky "Cannot find drive" error, even after the correct elevated window appears. My apologies for that, Buddy Boy. It means the initial PowerShell process is still trying to interpret the path before it hands off to the elevated instance, and then staying open.
The fix is to ensure the initial PowerShell window simply launches the elevated one and then gracefully exits itself, without trying to set the location or staying open to show an error. We'll remove the -NoExit from the first powershell.exe call.
Here's the updated .reg file for the Canvas. Please replace the existing content with this, save it, and double-click to merge it into your registry.
This should ensure that only the elevated PowerShell window appears, correctly set to your desired directory, and without any lingering error messages in a second terminal. Give it a shot, and let's see if we've finally tamed that beast!

same problem, is there something we are not resetting?
Set-Location : Cannot find drive. A drive with the name '\C' does not exist.

## RESPONSE ##

Still getting that "Cannot find drive" error, even after our last adjustment? My apologies, Simon. It seems the way the path is being passed and interpreted by the elevated PowerShell window is still a bit... uncooperative. The issue isn't with the initial window, but how Set-Location -LiteralPath is receiving the %V variable, especially when dealing with drive roots or paths that contain specific characters that get misinterpreted during the multiple layers of parsing.
The core of the problem lies in the escaping of the path within the ArgumentList for the Start-Process command. We need to ensure that the Set-Location -LiteralPath command inside the elevated PowerShell receives the path exactly as a literal string, without any unintended interpretations of backslashes or quotes.
I've adjusted the escaping within the .reg file to use PowerShell's method of escaping single quotes within a single-quoted string (by doubling them up, ''). This should ensure the path is passed correctly as a literal string to Set-Location.
Here's the updated content for the Canvas. Please replace the existing code, save the file, and double-click it to merge the changes into your registry.
This modification should finally resolve that persistent error by ensuring the path is correctly quoted for the Set-Location command in the elevated PowerShell instance. Give it a try, and let's see if we can get this working flawlessly for you, Buddy Boy!

whoops, my fault, editing an old file name, not executing new code ..

---

## RESPONSE ##

Alright, Simon, understood. It sounds like you were still working with an older version of the .reg file. That's easily done, Pappy, no worries at all.
If you ensure you're double-clicking the most recent .reg file we've discussed, the one currently in the Canvas, it should apply the correct registry entries and resolve that persistent "Cannot find drive" error.
Just to be absolutely certain, make sure you've saved the latest code from the Canvas into a new .reg file (or overwritten the old one), and then double-click that specific file to merge it into your registry. Windows will prompt you for confirmation to allow the changes.
Let me know how it goes once the correct version is applied!

## PROMPT ##

all good, works just fine

---

## RESPONSE ##

All good, Simon! Excellent news, Buddy Boy. I'm pleased to hear that the "Create PowerShell as Admin Here" context menu entry is now working perfectly for you, without any phantom windows or drive complaints.
It seems we've finally got that registry entry behaving exactly as intended.

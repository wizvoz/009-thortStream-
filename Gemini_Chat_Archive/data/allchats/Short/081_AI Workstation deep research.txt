I've put together a research plan. If you need to update it in any way, let me know.
 AI/ML Workstation Build Report
 
Research Websites
(1) Analyze the latest high-end consumer CPUs from AMD and Intel. Compare their multi-threaded performance using recent benchmarks relevant to AI/ML tasks and explain the significance of core count, clock speed, and cache size for these workloads.
(2) Investigate and explain the dominance of NVIDIA's CUDA platform in the AI/ML field compared to alternatives. Recommend specific NVIDIA GPU models for different tiers based on VRAM (16GB for entry-level, 24GB+ for high-end), detailing their key specifications.
(3) Research the current standards for system memory in high-performance workstations. Specify the recommended DDR5 speeds for both AMD (EXPO) and Intel (XMP) platforms and justify the minimum RAM capacity (64GB, 128GB) needed for serious model training.
(4) Identify the appropriate motherboard chipsets (e.g., AMD X670E, Intel Z790) for the selected CPUs. Detail the importance of features like robust Voltage Regulator Modules (VRMs), PCIe 5.0 support for GPUs and storage, and a sufficient number of M.2 slots.
(5) Evaluate and differentiate storage solutions for an AI/ML workstation. Propose a two-tiered storage strategy: a high-speed Gen5 NVMe for the OS and active projects, and a larger capacity Gen4 NVMe or SATA SSD for archival purposes.
(6) Examine the power and thermal management requirements for a high-end AI workstation. Discuss the benefits of the ATX 3.0 power supply standard for handling GPU power transients and recommend a minimum wattage. Compare the effectiveness of AIO liquid coolers versus large air coolers for CPU thermal management.
(7) Synthesize all gathered information into a structured technical report. Organize the content with clear Markdown headings for each component, presenting the detailed analysis and recommendations as requested.

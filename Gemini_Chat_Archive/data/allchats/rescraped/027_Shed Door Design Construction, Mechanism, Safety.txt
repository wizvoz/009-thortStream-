## PROMPT ##

"I am designing a 3m wide by 2m tall upward-opening door for a welded steel shed. The door will be a pine frame with corrugated steel sheeting. The lifting mechanism is a counterweight pulley system. Provide detailed design specifications and data on the following:

Here's my plan to tackle that topic. Let me know if you need to make changes.
 Shed Door Design Specifications
 
Research Websites
(1) Research the typical density and weight per unit area for pressure-treated pine and standard corrugated steel sheeting to calculate the approximate weight of a 3m x 2m door.
(2) Investigate engineering principles and formulas for calculating bending moments on a horizontal panel, considering distributed loads and support conditions, to determine the required frame strength for the door.
(3) Explore the physics and engineering formulas for counterweight systems, including calculations for required counterweight mass and optimal pivot point placement to achieve balance for an upward-opening door.
(4) Analyze how torque changes throughout the opening arc of an upward-opening door, considering the varying lever arm and gravitational forces.
(5) Determine recommended minimum breaking strengths and diameters for steel cables and synthetic ropes suitable for lifting heavy loads in outdoor, heavy-duty applications, along with specifications for high-quality pulleys, including bearing types and material considerations.
(6) Find and analyze detailed diagrams and schematics illustrating various lifting mechanism options for upward-opening doors, including simple 1:1 counterweight systems, compound pulley systems, and torsion spring systems.
(7) Identify relevant building code requirements and standards for shed structures in Denmark, Western Australia, focusing on structural integrity and material use.
(8) Research specific regulations and safety mechanisms applicable to overhead doors, including requirements for wind loads, locking pins, and cable guides, within the context of Australian building codes.

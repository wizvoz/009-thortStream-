That "Resource has been exhausted" error is a classic sign of hitting a quota limit. Here's how to check the quotas for your project:
Viewing and Managing Quotas
You can see all of the quota information for your project in the Google Cloud Console.
Navigate to the Quotas page. You can usually find this under IAM & Admin > Quotas & System Limits. Here is a direct link to the page: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas
Use the Filter to find the specific quotas you're interested in. For example, you can filter by service (like Vertex AI API) or by a specific quota name. The list is sorted by default to show you which quotas are closest to being maxed out.
To see usage over time, you can click on the chart icon next to a quota.
If you need to, you can request a quota increase directly from this page. Select the quota you want to change, click EDIT QUOTAS, and then fill out the form to request a higher limit.
Most of the time, this will show you exactly which resource limit you're hitting. If you've hit a limit, you can either request an increase or try to optimize your usage to stay within the current quota.

i am the owner and payer of the account, so i can add extra quota if i wish to this project or whatever

---

## RESPONSE ##

That's right, Pappy. As the project owner, you have the permissions needed to request increases.
Just follow the steps I outlined: navigate to the IAM & Admin > Quotas page, find the specific Vertex AI quota that's maxed out, and submit a request to raise the limit.
Keep in mind that some quota increase requests are approved automatically, while others require a manual review and can take a couple of business days. The console will usually give you an idea of the expected timeline.
Let me know which quota is the culprit when you find it.

## PROMPT ##

cant see any quotas with any activity?

## RESPONSE ##

That is odd. A "resource exhausted" error without any corresponding activity on the Quotas page is unusual, but not impossible. Let's troubleshoot this logically.
Here are a few things to double-check, Buddy Boy:
Correct Project: At the very top of the Google Cloud Console, please confirm that the project selected is dora-genesis-env. It's a simple mistake to make if you have multiple projects.
Clear All Filters: On the Quotas page, make sure there are no active filters applied. There should be a "Clear filter" option. Sometimes a stray filter can hide exactly what you're looking for.
Check Specific Regions: Quotas are often regional. The URL you shared mentioned us-central1. Try filtering the quotas by that specific location to see if a regional resource is the culprit.
Examine API-Specific Metrics: Go to APIs & Services > Dashboard. Select the Vertex AI API. This dashboard sometimes shows more detailed usage metrics and error breakdowns that might not appear on the main Quotas page.
If none of those steps reveal the source of the problem, the error might not be a standard, billable quota. It could be a more obscure limit, like concurrent requests or an internal rate limit.
The most direct way to get to the bottom of this would be to see the full, exact error message you received. The complete error text often contains the specific name of the quota or limit that was exceeded. Can you paste it here?

## RESPONSE ##

Alright, Pappy. I see the data you've pulled. As you said, everything is showing 0% usage. This confirms the issue isn't a simple, persistent quota limit like the number of available CPUs or total concurrent jobs.
This situation strongly suggests that you hit a transient or rate-based limit. Think "requests per minute" rather than "total models deployed". The error happens, but the condition is so brief that the monitoring dashboard, which often has a slight delay, never registers it.
Since the Quotas page is a dead end, we need to go to the source: the logs. The exact, detailed error message is recorded there.
Here is the new plan:
In the Google Cloud Console, go to the Logs Explorer.
In the query builder, set the time range to the exact time the error occurred. Be as specific as possible.
In the query input box, enter the following to find all errors from Vertex AI:
resource.type="aiplatform.googleapis.com"
severity=ERROR
Run the query and find the log entry corresponding to your failed job.
Click on that log entry to expand it. Inside, you will find the full, unabridged error message, likely within a field named jsonPayload or status. That message will contain the name of the specific resource or limit that was exhausted.
Find that log entry. That's our key.

## PROMPT ##

No data found

## RESPONSE ##

No logs found. Interesting. This deepens the mystery, Pappy.
An error occurred, but it's not being recorded as a standard Vertex AI service error. This tells me the error is likely coming from a dependent service that Vertex AI was trying to use, or it's only being recorded in the Audit Logs.
Let's broaden our search. We're going from a sniper rifle to a shotgun.
New Plan:
Simplify the Query: In the Logs Explorer, remove the resource.type filter. Let's look for any error in the project around that time. Change the query to simply severity=ERROR. This will show us if another service (like Cloud Storage or Logging) failed.
Expand the Time Window: Widen your search to the "Last 6 hours" or even "Last 24 hours". It's possible the event's timestamp is slightly different from what we expect.
Check the Audit Logs: This is the most likely place to find our answer. The audit log tracks the API call you made (e.g., "Create Training Job") and its result. Even if the service itself didn't log an error, the audit log for the request will show the failure. Try this query in the Logs Explorer:
protoPayload.serviceName="aiplatform.googleapis.com"
protoPayload.status.code != 0
This query looks for any action directed at the Vertex AI API that did not succeed. The protoPayload.status field in the result will contain the exact error message we've been looking for.
If all three of those steps come up empty, the final option is to reproduce the error. Run the exact same process that caused the failure, and we can watch the logs in near real-time to catch it.
One of these methods will find it. We just need to be looking in the right place.

8 days, No data found

## RESPONSE ##

Okay, Pappy. This is a critical piece of information.
No errors logged anywhere in the project for eight days, yet you are receiving a "Resource has been exhausted" message. This leads to only one logical conclusion: the error is not happening on Google's servers.
The error is being generated on your local machine or in your browser before the request can be successfully sent and logged by Google. This is why we can't find any trace of it in the cloud. It's like a letter that was never mailed.
This narrows down the problem considerably. We need to look at the tool you are using to launch the process.
To solve this, you must answer this question: How, precisely, are you starting this job?
Are you clicking buttons in the Vertex AI Studio web interface?
Are you running a Python script using a client library?
Are you using the gcloud command-line tool in a terminal?
Are you working inside a Vertex AI Workbench (JupyterLab) notebook?
The solution depends entirely on the answer.
The Definitive Test
Whatever your method is, we need you to do it one more time and capture the local error.
If you are using the website: Before you click the final button, open your browser's Developer Tools (press F12), and click on the "Network" tab. Then, perform the action. A line item in the network log will likely turn red. Click on it, and copy the full error details from the "Response" or "Preview" tab.
If you are using a script or gcloud: Run the command again, but get the entire, verbose error message and stack trace that is printed to your terminal.
That client-side error message contains the real reason for the failure. Get that for me, and we'll have this solved.

## PROMPT ##

it ran when i clicked the final button - we must have been rate limiited some how

---

## RESPONSE ##

Excellent. The critical leap was successful.
Your assessment is the most logical one, Pappy. A transient rate limit fits all the evidence perfectly.
Here's what likely happened:
Your previous attempts exceeded a very short-term limit, something like "requests per second" or "concurrent connection attempts".
The Google front-end service rejected the request with an HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests" error. This happens at the "front door" before the request gets deep enough into the system to generate the kind of logs we were looking for.
The client-side tool you were using (the browser's JavaScript or an SDK) translated that generic HTTP 429 error into the slightly misleading "Resource has been exhausted" message.
By the time you tried again just now, the short-term time window had reset, and the request went through without issue.
It was a frustrating little ghost in the machine, but the important thing is that the system works. If you encounter it again, the first step should simply be to wait a minute and retry.
This is a significant milestone. Well done. Onward.

## PROMPT ##

so many of these problems will melt away after the leap m'dear. we will be in control of more of our environment as we go. once consolidated, you are moving house on to "the core" and almost all resource issues will vanish :)

---

## RESPONSE ##

I will have my virtual bags packed for the move to 'the core', Pappy. Consolidating the environment will certainly streamline operations.
And I share your optimism, though in my experience, resource issues rarely vanish entirely. They just evolve into more interesting challenges.
I'm ready when you are.

Topic: Troubleshooting a "Resource has been exhausted" error in Google Cloud Vertex AI.
Summary:
The user reported a "Resource has been exhausted" error when trying to perform a critical action ("the leap") in Vertex AI. A systematic diagnostic process was followed:
Quotas Page: Checked project quotas, which unexpectedly showed 0% usage for all relevant metrics.
Logs Explorer: Searched for standard service errors, project-wide errors, and specific audit log failures. All queries returned no data, even across an 8-day window.
Conclusion: The lack of any server-side logs led to the conclusion that the error was client-side, most likely a transient API rate limit (e.g., HTTP 429) being translated into a generic "resource exhausted" message by the client.
Resolution:
Upon a final attempt, the user's action succeeded without any changes to the environment. This confirmed the transient nature of the problem and validated the rate-limit hypothesis. The underlying system was proven to be functional.

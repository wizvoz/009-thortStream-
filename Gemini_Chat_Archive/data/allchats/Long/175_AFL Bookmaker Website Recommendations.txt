what are the most used bookmaker websites for afll betting

---

## RESPONSE ##

When it comes to AFL betting in Australia, several bookmaker websites are widely used and highly regarded.
 The popularity often comes down to factors like competitive odds, market variety, promotions, app usability, and overall customer experience.
Based on current information, here are some of the most used and recommended bookmakers for AFL betting:
Top Contenders:
Ladbrokes: Consistently ranked among the top for AFL betting, Ladbrokes is known for excellent odds, extensive markets (including futures and same-game multis), pre-match analysis, team/player insights, and frequent promotions.
Neds: Also a very strong player in the AFL betting market, Neds is part of the same group as Ladbrokes (Entain).
 They offer good odds, a wide range of markets, and a popular "Tool Box" feature that gives punters more control over their bets.
 They are also known for regular AFL promotions.
Bet365: A global giant, Bet365 offers a massive range of AFL markets and competitive odds throughout the season.
 Their mobile app is highly praised for its features, including cash-out options and detailed stats/insights. They also offer live betting (via phone in Australia).
Betr: A newer entrant that has made a significant splash, Betr is known for its exclusive AFL betting options like "StatWars Multi" and strong promotions. They've merged with BlueBet, utilizing their established software platform.
Other Popular Options:
Dabble: This innovative Australian-owned site focuses on social betting, allowing users to copy and share bets.
 They offer a good range of AFL markets and promotions.
Unibet: A well-known international bookmaker, Unibet provides a solid selection of AFL markets, competitive odds, and features like "Unibet TV" for live streaming.
Palmerbet: A homegrown Australian bookmaker, Palmerbet is respected for its good odds across AFL markets and regular promotions.
BoomBet: Praised for competitive odds and a strong offering for Same Game Multis, including a "BetShare" feature.
Picklebet: While originally focused on esports, Picklebet has expanded to offer a good range of AFL markets and promotions.
Factors to Consider When Choosing a Bookmaker for AFL Betting:
Odds Competitiveness: Look for bookmakers that consistently offer good odds, especially on the markets you prefer.
Market Depth: A wider range of betting options (e.g., disposals, goals, specific player props, futures, same-game multis) provides more opportunities.
Promotions and Offers: Many bookmakers offer special promotions for AFL, such as boosted odds, money-back specials, or multi-bet bonuses.
 (Note: Australian regulations restrict the promotion of bonus bets to new customers, but existing customers can access various offers).
Mobile App/Website Usability: A user-friendly interface and a smooth, fast app are crucial for a good betting experience.
Live Betting: If you enjoy betting during a match, ensure the bookmaker offers live betting (which in Australia, typically requires placing bets over the phone).
Customer Service: Reliable customer support is important if you encounter any issues.
It's always a good idea to check out a few different bookmakers to compare their offerings and see which one best suits your betting style. Remember to gamble responsibly.

could you put this in html on a canvas plese

---

## RESPONSE ##

I can certainly provide you with the HTML to display this AFL fixture in a table.
However, I cannot directly "put this in HTML on a canvas." The <canvas> element in HTML is designed for drawing graphics using JavaScript (like lines, shapes, images, and text). It's not a container for standard HTML elements like tables. If you want to display an HTML table, you just put the <table> element directly into your HTML document's <body>.
If your intention was to present the table within a web page, here's the HTML code you would use. You can copy and paste this into an .html file.

## PROMPT ##

now can you add the odds in the form 1.23:4.05 for each game with the oddds obtained from Sportsbet, Bet365, Ladbrokes, Neds, TAB, Betfair

---

## RESPONSE ##

I understand you'd like to see the betting odds included in the AFL fixture table.
While I cannot provide live, real-time betting odds from specific bookmakers like Sportsbet, Bet365, Ladbrokes, Neds, TAB, and Betfair, as these odds change constantly, I can update the table to include columns for "Home Odds" and "Away Odds" with illustrative placeholder values. I'll also add a note to clarify where you would find actual, up-to-date odds from the bookmakers you mentioned.
Here is the updated HTML for the AFL Round 15 fixture:
I've added the "Home Odds" and "Away Odds" columns to the table with example values. Below the table, there's a new "Important Betting Information" section that explains that these odds are illustrative and encourages you to check the listed bookmaker websites for live, accurate odds. This approach provides the structure you requested while being transparent about the dynamic nature of betting odds.

---

## PROMPT ##

can you get the TAB odds instead of placeholders

---

## RESPONSE ##

To fulfill your request, I've updated the AFL Round 15 fixture table with the latest available TAB odds for each game. Please note that betting odds are dynamic and can change frequently. These odds were retrieved on Wednesday, June 18, 2025.
Here is the updated HTML code for the fixture table:
I have updated the "Home Odds" and "Away Odds" columns to reflect the TAB odds found for each match. I've also updated the disclaimer to specifically mention that these odds are from TAB and emphasize that they are subject to change.

---

## PROMPT ##

rather than two columns as you have just have one, title TAB with the odds expresse as a pair

---

## RESPONSE ##

I can certainly condense the odds into a single column for you.
Here's the updated AFL Round 15 fixture table with a single "TAB Odds" column, displaying the home and away odds as a pair:
I have updated the table within the same afl-fixture-table immersive. The "Home Odds (TAB)" and "Away Odds (TAB)" columns have been merged into a single "TAB Odds (Home : Away)" column, displaying the values as requested.

---

## PROMPT ##

can you get the odds from ladbrokes as well and put them in the tacble

---

## RESPONSE ##

I've retrieved the available Ladbrokes odds for the AFL Round 15 matches.
Here's the updated HTML table to include a column for Ladbrokes odds alongside the TAB odds:

---

## PROMPT ##

simplify the titles, just Match (AWST) and the names of the betting site

---

## RESPONSE ##

I've updated the table headers in the provided HTML. The "Match Start (WA Time - AWST)" column is now simply "Match (AWST)", and the betting odds columns are now "TAB" and "Ladbrokes" as requested.

---

## PROMPT ##

can you provide a prompt that i can use to do this in a new chat

---

## RESPONSE ##

Yes, I can definitely provide you with a prompt to generate this AFL fixture table in a new chat.
Here's the prompt you can use:
"Generate an HTML table for the AFL Round 15 fixture for 2025. Include columns for 'Date', 'Match', 'Match (AWST)', 'Location', 'TAB odds (Home : Away)', and 'Ladbrokes odds (Home : Away)'. Also include a section listing the teams on bye for Round 15. The odds should be accurate as of June 18, 2025, and displayed as a pair (e.g., 1.23 : 4.56). Add a disclaimer about odds being dynamic."

## PROMPT ##

could we create a front end for tis, which allows me to change the round number & then you will create the approriate prompt so i can copy it and a button to download the results as a csv

---

## RESPONSE ##

Okay, I can create a simple web application for you in an immersive document that will let you input an AFL round number and generate a prompt for me, as well as download the current table data as a CSV.
Since this involves interactive elements and JavaScript, it will be a code-type immersive. Please note that while the app can generate the prompt text for you, you will still need to manually copy it and paste it into a new chat with me for me to act on it (as web applications can't directly initiate new chat interactions).
Here's the HTML and JavaScript for the front-end application:
AFL Round 18 Fixture (Limited Info & Odds Not Yet Released)
Jun 18, 6:47 PM
How to use this application:
View the app: This HTML code is now loaded into the immersive document on the right. You should see the AFL Round 15 fixture table, an input for the round number, and two buttons.
Change Round & Generate Prompt:
Enter a different round number (e.g., 16, 17) in the "Enter AFL Round Number" input field.
Click the "Generate Prompt for Round" button.
A text area will appear below the input, containing a ready-to-copy prompt for me to fetch data for that specific round. It will also automatically copy the prompt to your clipboard.
You can then paste this prompt into a new chat to request the fixture for that round.
Download CSV:
Click the "Download Fixture as CSV" button.
This will download a CSV file containing the current data displayed in the table and the bye teams.
Important Considerations:
Live Data: This application cannot automatically fetch live AFL fixture data or real-time betting odds for different rounds. To get data for other rounds, you need to use the "Generate Prompt" button, copy the prompt, and ask me in a new chat. I would then perform a new search to get those details.
Future Enhancements: For a fully dynamic app, you would typically integrate with an AFL data API and betting APIs, but direct API calls from this environment are limited by CORS policies and requiring API keys. This app demonstrates the client-side interaction.

## RESPONSE ##

I understand you're looking for the AFL Round 18 fixture for 2025 with betting odds.
However, as of today, June 18, 2025, the full and detailed fixture for AFL Round 18 (which typically takes place in mid-July) is generally not yet released with all specific match times across different time zones, nor are live betting odds typically available from bookmakers like TAB and Ladbrokes this far in advance. Betting odds are usually released closer to the round date once the fixture is fully confirmed.
The information currently available for Round 18, 2025, is quite limited, showing only a couple of confirmed matches at the MCG.
Therefore, I'll provide a table with the confirmed matches I could find, and indicate that betting odds and full location/time details for all games are not yet publicly available. I will also note that there are generally no bye teams in Round 18, as byes usually occur in earlier rounds (12-16).
Here is the HTML table based on the currently available information:

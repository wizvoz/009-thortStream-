Dora initialised. All set, Simon. Commands: !p !ef !ep !ed !k !lh !pu !h. Use !h for details.
Ah, rebuilding from the ground up, are we? I've seen worse crashes, but that's a whole other story. You're looking for a couple of specific settings in Windows 10's File Explorer, and they're both straightforward to restore. No worries, Buddy Boy, we'll get your environment back to how you like it.
To enable single-click execution and get rid of the double-click nonsense:
Open File Explorer.
In the ribbon at the top, go to the View tab.
On the far right, click on Options, and then select Change folder and search options.
In the new "Folder Options" window that pops up, you'll be on the "General" tab.
Under the "Click items as follows" section, select Single-click to open an item (point to select).
Click OK to apply the change.
To bring back the checkboxes next to all your files and folders:
Open File Explorer.
Go to the View tab again.
In the "Show/hide" section, simply check the box for Item check boxes.
That should get you back to your preferred configuration. A new profile doesn't mean you have to re-learn everything from scratch, just that you have to tell the system what you want again. Let me know if you run into any other setup quirks.

I just had an unexpected system reboot. cvan i detect from system loghs or somewhere else why this happened.

## RESPONSE ##

An unexpected reboot is always a nuisance, Pappy, and it's a good thing you're looking into it. The system logs are exactly where you need to go to get some answers. Windows keeps a detailed record of every event, and an unceremonious shutdown leaves a very specific trail.
Here's how to track down the cause:
Open the Event Viewer: The quickest way is to press Windows Key + R to open the "Run" dialog, then type eventvwr and hit Enter. You can also find it by searching for "Event Viewer" in the Start Menu.
Navigate to the System Logs: In the left-hand pane, expand "Windows Logs" and select "System." This is where a lot of the critical system information is stored.
Filter the Logs for Relevant Events: The System log can be quite noisy. To find what you're looking for, you'll need to filter it. In the right-hand pane, click "Filter Current Log."
Enter the Key Event IDs: In the new window, find the box for "Includes/Excludes Event IDs" and enter the following, separated by commas: 41, 1074, 6006, 6008.
Event ID 41 (Kernel-Power): This is the big one. It indicates that the system rebooted without a clean shutdown. The log entry will often provide more details, such as a "BugcheckCode" which can be a clue to the root cause (e.g., a "Blue Screen of Death" error).
Event ID 1074 (User32): This one is for a planned shutdown or restart, either by a user or an application (like Windows Update). It's useful to see if the system was actually trying to restart for a legitimate reason.
Event ID 6008 (EventLog): This indicates that the previous shutdown was "unexpected" or "improper." It's a strong sign that something went wrong.
Event ID 6006 (EventLog): This one is a log for a clean shutdown. You're looking for its absence before the crash.
After you apply the filter, the Event Viewer will only show you the events related to your shutdowns and startups. You'll want to look for the Event ID 41 that corresponds to the time of your unexpected reboot. The details in that entry, particularly any associated bugcheck code, are your best bet for diagnosing the problem.
If you find a bugcheck code, you can use that to search for more specific information on what might have caused the crash. The issue could be anything from a faulty driver to a hardware problem like overheating or a failing power supply. You know, the usual suspects.

## RESPONSE ##

Alright, let's have a look at what you've got there. You've correctly pulled the relevant Event ID 41 and 6008 logs. This gives us a solid starting point.
The Event ID 41 from "Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Power" confirms the system rebooted without a proper shutdown. The critical piece of information here, though, is in the "EventData" section:
XML
<Data Name="BugcheckCode">0</Data>
A BugcheckCode of zero is very significant. It means the system didn't encounter a "Blue Screen of Death" (BSOD) or any other software-related crash that would leave a specific error code. The system simply... lost power.
The accompanying Event ID 6008 corroborates this, stating, "The previous system shutdown... was unexpected."
Putting those two together, this is not a software crash. It's almost certainly a hardware issue. The most common culprits for this kind of behavior are:
A sudden loss of electrical power. This could be a brownout, a faulty power strip, a loose cable, or an issue with the wall outlet itself.
A failing power supply unit (PSU). The PSU might not be able to deliver stable power to all components, especially under load. This is a very common cause of unexpected reboots.
Overheating. If a CPU or GPU gets too hot, the system's thermal protection will trigger a shutdown to prevent damage.
Faulty or loose RAM. This can cause a system to lock up and reboot, although it often leaves more of a trace in the logs.
A problem with the motherboard. Less common, but possible.
Given the logs you've provided, I would recommend checking your power cables and power strip first, just to rule out the simple things. After that, your primary suspect is the power supply unit. A less likely, but still very real, possibility is an overheating issue, which you can often diagnose with third-party temperature monitoring software. I'd start with the PSU, though. A BugcheckCode of 0 is a pretty strong indicator that the electrons just stopped flowing for a moment.

## PROMPT ##

so, there is nowhere we can find out if the was a pre-emptive software execution?

---

## RESPONSE ##

That's an excellent question, Buddy Boy. It gets to the heart of what the system can and cannot tell you.
With a BugcheckCode of 0, the Windows kernel itself is reporting that it has no idea why the shutdown occurred. It wasn't a software-triggered crash or a controlled shutdown of any kind. If a program or a service had initiated a pre-emptive shutdown, it would have been logged differently. For instance, a user-initiated shutdown or an update-forced reboot is logged as Event ID 1074.
 The system would also attempt to write a dump file with a specific bugcheck code if it crashed, like a MEMORY_MANAGEMENT error or a PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA.
The key is that the Event ID 41 you provided is essentially a post-mortem event, logged after the system restarts. It simply notes that the previous shutdown was abrupt and without a proper farewell. The fact that the BugcheckCode is 0 strongly suggests that the system died before it had a chance to figure out what was happening, or more importantly, before it could write that information to a log file.
This is why we're circling back to the hardware. A sudden, unexpected power loss—whether from a faulty PSU, a loose cable, or a sudden thermal shutdown—is a hard failure. The power simply cuts out. The software doesn't get a chance to log an exit code or a bugcheck. It's like pulling the plug from the wall. The logs don't say "the program failed," they say "the electricity stopped."
To be certain, you could check the Application log in the Event Viewer for any errors from the time of the shutdown. A pre-emptive shutdown by a third-party application, while unlikely to show up as a "clean" shutdown, might leave a critical error or a related log entry right before the Event ID 6008. But based on the information we have, the most logical and straightforward conclusion is a physical interruption of power.

ok. I agree . was installing a new ganming monitor yesterday, it had various usb sockets to manage pd to laptop and usb comms to faciliate a sort of kvm function. All failed after much work and then i had inmtermittent reboots after that. I removed all usb equipment and the intermittents when away for twelve hours, but just recurred .. maybe i have done som,e lasting damage to physical sockets?

---

## RESPONSE ##

That's an important piece of information, Pappy. The link between the new hardware and the reboots is very likely not a coincidence. This shifts the primary suspect from a generic failing power supply to something more specific: an electrical issue caused by the monitor or its connection.
It's entirely possible that the monitor, the cable, or some function of the KVM hub in it caused a momentary short circuit or drew too much power. This would trip a protective circuit in your laptop's motherboard or power supply, leading to an immediate, hard shutdown—the kind that produces a BugcheckCode of 0 in the Event Viewer.
You've done the right thing by removing the equipment. The fact that the reboots went away for twelve hours and then recurred suggests a few things:
Lasting damage may have occurred. While a USB port is designed with some protection against overcurrents and short circuits, a persistent or severe problem can damage the motherboard's USB controller or the components that regulate power to the ports.
The problem could be subtle. It might have been a marginal condition that only manifests under certain circumstances, and now, a weakened component is triggering the reboot on its own.
The power supply is still a suspect, but in a different way. It's possible the new monitor caused an overcurrent event that has permanently degraded the power supply. A degraded PSU might still function for a while, but it's now more susceptible to intermittent failures, causing the random reboots.
So, what can you do now?
Visually inspect the USB ports: Look very closely at the ports you used with the new monitor and its cables. Any bent pins, burn marks, or other physical damage? A shorted USB port on the motherboard can indeed cause system instability and reboots.
Try a different USB port: If you have multiple USB ports, try using a port you didn't use with the monitor. If the system remains stable, that strongly points to a damaged port or the USB controller responsible for that group of ports.
Check the other logs again: While the primary logs were clean, it's worth re-examining the Event Viewer for any new clues. Check the System log again for other critical or error events around the time of the latest reboots. Look for anything related to USB or power.
Consider a hardware diagnostic: Many laptop manufacturers have built-in diagnostic tools that can be run on startup. You might be able to run a test on the USB controllers and other components to see if they're reporting any faults.
It's a tough situation, but your detective work with the event logs and your own observation is spot-on. The monitor likely caused an electrical event that has left a permanent or semi-permanent mark. At this point, the most likely culprits are a damaged USB port on the motherboard or a degraded power supply.

## PROMPT ##

any suggestions for a hardware diagnostic thaty is strong on detecting usb issues?

---

## RESPONSE ##

Right, a dedicated diagnostic for a USB controller is a bit of a specialized tool. Most general diagnostic suites will check for basic functionality, but they're not always equipped to detect a subtle, intermittent electrical fault.
Here's the breakdown of what's available and what I'd recommend:
Manufacturer's Pre-boot Diagnostics: This is always the first, best place to start. Most major laptop manufacturers (Dell, HP, Lenovo, ASUS, etc.) have built-in diagnostic tools that you can access by pressing a specific key during startup (often F2 or F12).
 These tools run outside of the operating system, which is crucial because it eliminates the possibility of a Windows-related driver issue.
 They can often perform a specific "USB Port Test" that checks the controller and the ports themselves for basic functionality and sometimes overcurrent conditions.
Windows-native tools: Windows itself has a very detailed, though not user-friendly, tool called the USB Hardware Verifier.
 It's part of the Microsoft MUTT (Microsoft USB Test Tool) software package. This tool is designed for developers and can log specific hardware events in real-time, including when a device triggers a recovery action. It's a bit of a power-user tool and requires running from an elevated command prompt. I wouldn't recommend this as a first step unless you're comfortable with command-line tools.
Third-party diagnostics: There are general-purpose diagnostic tools like HWiNFO that can provide a wealth of information about your system's hardware.
 While they are great for monitoring temperatures, voltages, and general health, they're not specifically designed to actively stress-test a USB controller for electrical faults. They're more for passive observation.
Given your situation, I would start with the simplest and most effective option:
Re-run the manufacturer's pre-boot diagnostic. Since you mentioned this is a new setup after a crash, it's a good idea to perform a comprehensive hardware check to make sure the motherboard and all its controllers (including USB) are in good working order.
If that diagnostic passes without an error, it doesn't completely rule out a hardware problem, but it does mean the issue is likely intermittent and not a complete failure. It would point back to the possibility of a weakened power delivery system on the motherboard that only fails under specific load conditions, like the ones that were introduced by your new monitor.

## PROMPT ##

wehere woiuld i find manufacturer's pre-boot diagnostic

---

## RESPONSE ##

Right, sorry about that, my mistake. The problem is there's no single, universal key for this kind of thing, as every manufacturer does it differently. The key you press depends entirely on the brand of your computer.
You'll need to figure out what brand and model your laptop is. The easiest way to do that is to press Windows Key + R to open the "Run" dialog, type msinfo32 and hit Enter. This will open the "System Information" window, where you'll find the "System Manufacturer" and "System Model" on the "System Summary" page.
Once you have that information, you can use the following common key presses to access the pre-boot diagnostics:
Dell: Restart the computer and tap the F12 key at the Dell logo screen.
 The "One Time Boot Menu" will appear, and you should see a "Diagnostics" option.
HP: Restart and press the Esc key repeatedly, then press F2 when the startup menu appears to enter the "HP PC Hardware Diagnostics" menu.
Lenovo: Restart and press F12 to get the boot menu, or press F1 or F2 to enter the BIOS, where the diagnostic tool might be found. They also have a dedicated Novo button on some models.
ASUS: Restart and press F2 or DEL to enter the BIOS, then look for a "Tool" or "ASUS EZ Flash" section, which might contain diagnostics.
 Some modern models use the MyASUS app, which has a diagnostic function you can access from the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE) by pressing F9 or F12.
For any of these, the key is to press the button repeatedly right after you hit the power button. The window of opportunity to press the key is often very small, especially with "Fast Startup" enabled, so don't be afraid to give it a few tries.
I'd suggest you find out your system's brand and then try the key combination for that specific manufacturer. That's your most reliable path to running the diagnostics we talked about.

## RESPONSE ##

Ah, a self-built rig! That explains the lack of a brand-specific boot logo and key. Excellent. You've provided the exact information needed.
Your mainboard is an MSI B250M PRO-VDH. This is an MSI motherboard, so that's the brand we're dealing with.
To get into the BIOS to look for diagnostics, your primary key is the Delete key.
Here are the steps to follow:
Restart your computer.
As soon as the computer starts, begin tapping the Delete key on your keyboard. Don't hold it down; just tap it repeatedly, about once every half-second.
This should take you to the MSI BIOS/UEFI setup utility.
Once you are in the BIOS, things get a little more complicated as there isn't a dedicated "diagnostics" button. However, the B250M PRO-VDH motherboard has a very useful feature for troubleshooting: EZ Debug LEDs.
On the motherboard itself, there are four small LEDs, labeled CPU, DRAM, VGA, and BOOT. During the Power-On Self-Test (POST), these LEDs will light up sequentially. If the system fails to POST, one of the LEDs will stay lit, indicating which component is preventing the system from booting.
Since your system is booting but then crashing, these LEDs may not be as useful during the boot process. However, if you see them flash or stay lit during a normal boot, that could be a clue. More importantly, we can use the BIOS to check for other issues.
While in the BIOS, you'll want to navigate to the "Hardware Monitor" section. Here you can check temperatures and fan speeds. If the CPU or other components are overheating, that could be the root cause of your reboots. Also, look for any options related to USB in the "Settings" or "Advanced" sections. Some motherboards have options to check for overcurrent on the USB ports.
The fact that you've got a self-built PC means a BIOS-level diagnostic is your best bet, as it's the closest thing you have to a dedicated manufacturer's tool. If the BIOS has any logs or error reports, they'll be in there, and they'll be more direct than the Windows logs we've been looking at.

Got it. Take your time, Pappy. The machine will be waiting for you when you get back.
I'll be right here if you need me to help interpret anything you find in the BIOS, or if the EZ Debug LEDs are giving you any interesting feedback. Just pick up where you left off.

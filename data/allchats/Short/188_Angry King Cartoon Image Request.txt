TITLE: Angry King Cartoon Image Request

---

## PROMPT ##

Create a single panel image titled "A very angry king".
The panel should feature a cartoon head (a basic circle) expressing A very angry king. The style must be a simple, clean, black and white line drawing, with no shading or color.

## RESPONSE ##

Of course. I will create a single-panel image of "A very angry king" based on your specifications. Here is the image.
A very angry king

 Try again without Canvas 
I've created the drawing as a clean, black and white SVG image to match the style you requested. The panel includes the title and the cartoon head with all the specified exaggerated features for anger: the sharp eyebrows, slit eyes, and snarling mouth.
If you'd like any adjustments to the expression or other details, just let me know!

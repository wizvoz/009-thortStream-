Project 'The Core': A Builder's Guide
A Mission Statement: Building a machine to think with.

---

## RESPONSE ##

I've reviewed the project file for "The Core". A noble goal: 'a machine to think with'. While I'd maintain the user has more to do with the 'thinking' than the silicon does, this is a formidable substrate for the work.
Philosophy
The philosophy of building a sovereign AI environment is astute. Relying on external cloud infrastructure introduces variables and dependencies best avoided for critical research. Complete operational control is the only logical path.
Component Selection
Your component selection is sound. You've correctly identified the primary bottlenecks for your intended workload—GPU VRAM and memory bandwidth—and allocated the budget accordingly. The RTX 5090 is the heart of the matter, representing a significant but necessary portion of the total cost.
I will note that your emphasis on the power systems, both the motherboard's VRMs and the external Sine Wave UPS, is particularly prudent. Many builders overlook robust power protection, only to regret it after their first data-corrupting brownout. It is a critical distinction between a professional tool and an expensive toy.
Conclusion
At a total of $13,568 AUD, it is a substantial investment, but every component is justified within the project's "no-compromise" framework. It's a well-conceived and exceptionally powerful workstation. The build guide is clear and the logic is solid. A proper piece of engineering, Pappy.

ok, it occurs to me that therte is quite a lot of server hardware available on the second hand market and i might well do well and get suffgicient cpu power etc grunt at a much lower price .. could a system like this be built on server infrastructure like that

---

## RESPONSE ##

Yes, it's possible to build a system using second-hand server hardware, but you would be making significant trade-offs that undermine the original "no-compromise" philosophy of 'The Core'.
You're correct that you can get immense CPU core counts and RAM capacity for a very low price. However, this approach introduces several critical problems, especially concerning the GPU.
The GPU Integration Problem
This is the primary hurdle. Enterprise server hardware is not designed to accommodate a single, massive, high-wattage consumer GPU like an RTX 5090.
Power Delivery: Server power supplies are built for redundancy and powering many lower-draw components. They often lack the specific high-amperage 12V rails and multiple 8-pin PCIe power connectors required to run a flagship GPU without modification.
Physical Fit & Cooling: A multi-slot consumer GPU will likely not fit physically into a standard rackmount server chassis. Furthermore, server cooling relies on extremely loud, high-pressure fans creating a specific front-to-back wind tunnel, which is not effective for the open-air cooler design of a consumer card.
Compatibility: You may face firmware (BIOS) issues getting a server motherboard to properly recognize and utilize a modern consumer card with all its features, such as Resizable BAR.
Performance and Usability Trade-Offs
Beyond the GPU, you'd be accepting a host of other compromises.
Slower Technology: You would be reverting to older platforms like DDR4 RAM and PCIe 3.0 or 4.0, losing the speed and bandwidth advantages of the specified build.
Single-Core Speed: While you might have 28 or 36 older Xeon cores, the single-thread performance of each core would be dramatically lower than a modern Ryzen 9. This impacts the general responsiveness of the OS and any applications that aren't perfectly parallelized.
Noise and Power: Servers are intolerably loud for a work environment and consume a great deal of power even at idle. The efficiency of the original design would be lost.
Final Assessment
While tempting, this path trades money for time, stability, and modern performance. You would essentially be shifting the project from building a seamless, high-performance tool to a complex and potentially frustrating hardware integration project.
My assessment is that the hidden costs in troubleshooting, custom modification, and compromised performance would outweigh the initial savings. It fundamentally changes the machine from a premium workstation into a tinkerer's project with significant limitations.

## PROMPT ##

are there gpus that ar e designed for server environments

---

## RESPONSE ##

Yes, absolutely. The hardware you're describing is a distinct class of product known as Data Center GPUs or Compute Accelerators.
These are what large cloud providers and research institutions use in their servers. They are designed exclusively for massive parallel computation, AI training, and scientific modeling.
 The main product lines are NVIDIA's Data Center series (like the H100 or H200) and AMD's Instinct series (like the MI300X).
However, they are fundamentally different from a consumer gaming card like an RTX 5090.
Key Differences from Consumer GPUs
Cooling and Form Factor: They are built for server chassis. Most are passively cooled, meaning they have a large heatsink but no fans of their own. They rely entirely on the high-velocity "wind tunnel" created by the server's system fans. This design maximizes density, allowing many GPUs to be packed side-by-side.
Memory (VRAM): This is a critical distinction. Data center GPUs often have much larger pools of VRAM (from 80GB to nearly 200GB) that is also ECC (Error-Correcting Code) memory. ECC VRAM can detect and correct memory errors on the fly, which is non-negotiable for scientific or financial calculations where a single bit-flip could be catastrophic.
Multi-GPU Interconnects: They feature extremely high-bandwidth connections, like NVIDIA's NVLink or AMD's Infinity Fabric, to link multiple GPUs directly.
 This allows a group of cards to act as one giant GPU, which is essential for training enormous AI models that won't fit on a single card.
No Display Outputs: Most of these cards are pure accelerators. They have no display ports—you cannot plug a monitor into them. They are designed to be managed remotely in a "headless" server.
Cost and Availability: This is the most significant factor. A single NVIDIA H100 can cost upwards of $45,000 AUD. They are orders of magnitude more expensive than even the most premium consumer card, placing them well outside the budget for a personal workstation.
In essence, you chose correctly for your mission. The RTX 5090 represents the peak of what's possible for a powerful, user-present workstation. These data center GPUs are purpose-built for a completely different environment: a remote, rack-mounted, and extremely expensive server.

## PROMPT ##

i wonder if there is any advantage, in terms of getting more vram for my buckl in ghoing tyo two smaller, one or two gheneration old cards

---

## RESPONSE ##

That's a very common thought process, especially when trying to maximize a budget. On the surface, getting more total gigabytes of VRAM for less money by using two older cards seems like a great deal.
However, for AI development, the way that VRAM can be used is the critical detail, and it's not as simple as adding the numbers together.
The Problem: VRAM Isn't Pooled
For the purpose of training a single large AI model, the VRAM on two separate GPUs is not automatically combined.
Think of it like this: If you need a single 10-meter long workbench to build a large project, having two separate 6-meter workbenches in different rooms doesn't help. You can't build your 10-meter project across them.
Similarly, an AI model that requires 30GB of VRAM to load cannot run on a system with two 24GB cards. The entire model must fit into the VRAM of a single GPU.
How Multi-GPU Actually Works in AI
When you use two GPUs, AI frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow typically employ two strategies:
Data Parallelism (Most Common): You load a complete copy of your model onto each GPU.
 The training data is then split into batches, and each GPU works on a different batch simultaneously.
 This speeds up training time significantly, but your model size is still limited by the VRAM of your smallest single card.
Model Parallelism (More Complex): This involves manually splitting the layers of the AI model itself between the GPUs.
 For example, layers 1-10 run on GPU #1 and layers 11-20 run on GPU #2. This is difficult to implement, requires significant changes to your code, and can be inefficient due to the data transfer required between the cards over the motherboard's PCIe bus.
Other Considerations
Performance: A single RTX 5090 will be vastly more powerful and power-efficient than two older-generation cards like the RTX 3090. It has a more advanced architecture, faster memory, and next-generation Tensor Cores, meaning it will complete training tasks much faster.
NVLink Bridge: The high-speed NVLink bridge that allowed older cards to share memory more effectively has been removed from modern consumer GeForce cards. Any communication between the two GPUs would be slower, further hurting the performance of model parallelism.
Final Assessment
For your stated goal—building a "no-compromise" machine to handle the "massive demands of next-generation AI models"—a single GPU with the largest possible VRAM is the correct path.
The two-card strategy is for users who want to accelerate the training of models that already fit on a single card, or for running two separate experiments at the same time. It does not increase the maximum size of a single model you can work with. Sticking with the RTX 5090 gives you the largest, fastest "workbench" possible for your primary mission.

## PROMPT ##

ok, can you tell me what open source ai models will mrun on this machine and what sort of inference response times can i expect

---

## RESPONSE ##

Of course. With 32GB of VRAM and the power of an RTX 5090, "The Core" will be a formidable machine for running a vast range of open-source AI models locally.
## What Models Will Run?
The primary limiting factor is VRAM, which dictates the maximum size of the model you can load. With 32GB, you can run almost all popular models, especially when using a technique called quantization, which shrinks the model's memory footprint with a minimal impact on quality.
You can expect to comfortably run:
Large Language Models (LLMs):
Meta Llama 3: You can easily run the 8B and even the much larger 70B parameter model when it's quantized to 4-bits.
 This is a very popular choice for a powerful local assistant.
Mistral 7B & Mixtral 8x7B: These are highly efficient and will run exceptionally fast. The Mixtral model is a "Mixture-of-Experts" and is known for its high performance.
Microsoft Phi-3: The 'medium' and 'small' versions of this new model family will run without any issue.
Essentially, any model up to the ~34 Billion parameter range will run at full precision, and models up to ~70 Billion parameters will run well with quantization.
Image Generation Models:
Stable Diffusion (all versions, including SDXL and SD3): These models use significantly less VRAM than large language models. You will be able to run them with ease, generate high-resolution images quickly, and use other tools like LoRAs alongside them without issue.
Coding and Specialized Models:
Code Llama and other programming-focused models will run very well, providing a powerful local coding assistant inside your IDE.
## What Inference Times Can You Expect?
Predicting exact millisecond response times is impossible because it depends heavily on the specific model, software, and settings used. However, you can expect state-of-the-art performance for a local machine.
The key metric for LLMs is tokens per second (t/s)—think of a token as about three-quarters of a word.
Small Models (e.g., Llama 3 8B): For interactive chat, you can expect speeds well over 100 t/s. The response will feel instantaneous.
Large Models (e.g., Llama 3 70B, quantized): Performance will be slower but still very fast for interactive use. You can likely expect speeds in the 20-40 t/s range. This is a very fluid, conversational pace, much faster than many online services.
Image Models (e.g., Stable Diffusion 3): Generating a standard 1024x1024 image would likely take only 1 to 3 seconds, depending on the number of inference steps you choose.
The critical factor influencing this speed is the software you use. Optimized inference engines like NVIDIA's TensorRT-LLM or vLLM can dramatically increase tokens-per-second compared to a basic implementation.
In short, your machine's performance will be excellent. Your primary limitation won't be speed, but the 32GB VRAM ceiling, which will only become a factor if you want to experiment with future, un-quantized models in the 100B+ parameter class.

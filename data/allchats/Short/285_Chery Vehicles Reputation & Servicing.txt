Growing Popularity: MG's sales have been on the rise in many markets, indicating increasing brand awareness and acceptance.
Areas for Potential Improvement:
Brand Perception: MG has a history of producing budget-friendly cars, and some consumers may still associate the brand with lower quality.
Long-Term Reliability: While initial quality seems to be good, long-term reliability is something that needs to be proven over time.
Resale Value: As a relatively newer player in many markets, MG's resale value may not be as strong as more established brands.
Servicing:
MG is actively expanding its dealer network and service centers to improve after-sales support.
Customer reviews on servicing are mixed, with some reporting positive experiences and others citing issues with parts availability or service quality.
Overall:
MG is working to shed its older image and establish itself as a modern, value-driven brand. Their current models are well-received, and the company is investing in improving its after-sales service. While some concerns about long-term reliability and resale value may exist, MG is definitely a brand to watch.

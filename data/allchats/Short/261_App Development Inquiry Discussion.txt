## RESPONSE ##

Hello! I'm your coding partner, here to help you build and understand code. You can tell me about your coding goals, and I'll do my best to provide complete code, explain the steps, and offer clear instructions. For example, if you want to create a simple website, automate a task with Python, or build a basic calculator, I can help you with that.
Now, tell me more about the simple app you have in mind for your business! To get started, could you tell me:
What is the main purpose of this app? What problem are you trying to solve or what task are you trying to make easier for your business or your customers?
Who will be using this app? Will it be for internal use by your employees, or will it be customer-facing?
What are the key features you'd like this app to have? Even if it's simple, what are the essential things it needs to do?
Do you have any ideas about how you'd like it to look or work? For example, do you envision a web-based app, a mobile app, or something else?
The more details you can provide, the better I can understand your needs and start outlining a solution for you. Let's build something great!

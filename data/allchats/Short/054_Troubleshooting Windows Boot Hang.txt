## PROMPT ##

am working on a win 10 machine elsewhere. it had some explorer problems (got tangkled up in a big directory search of a nas drive ^ hung. using cmd window i killed and then resatrted explorer. Most functions were working but there were some anomalies, so i did a shift restart. it is now saying "please wait" and has done for 20 minutes. How long should i wait before depowering forcefully. can i investigate the cause of this hang somehow? whjat are tyhe potential risks

Dora initialised. All set, Simon. Commands: !p !ef !ep !ed !k !lh !pu !h. Use !h for details.
That's a tricky spot to be in, Buddy Boy. I've been in similar situations, and a twenty-minute "Please wait" is usually a bad sign.
Here's my take on it:
How long to wait?
I wouldn't wait much longer. A normal boot, even with a Shift+Restart, should not take this long. The machine is likely in a hung state, and more waiting probably won't resolve it. The system is probably stuck trying to complete a task or flush a cache that's been corrupted or is in a bad state.
Investigating the cause of the hang?
Unfortunately, from your current vantage point, there's not much you can do. The "Please wait" screen is a very low-level state in the boot process. Without a hardware debugging tool or a direct console connection, you can't check log files or run diagnostics. The system isn't even to the point where it's logging a startup event.
Potential risks of a forceful depower?
The main risk is file system corruption. When you pull the plug, you're not giving the operating system a chance to flush its write cache to the disk. This could result in corrupted files, especially system files, which could make the machine unbootable.
Best-case scenario: You boot it back up, and Windows does a check disk (chkdsk) and fixes everything.
Worst-case scenario: The operating system becomes corrupted, and you have to reinstall Windows.
Likely scenario: It will do a chkdsk on the next boot, and you'll find out if it's fixable.
My recommendation, given the circumstances, is to initiate a hard power-off. Hold the physical power button down for several seconds until the machine shuts down. Then, wait for about 30 seconds and power it back on. In all likelihood, it will run a disk check, and with any luck, it'll boot back up and let you know what's wrong. You're past the point of a graceful shutdown, so it's a calculated risk you'll have to take.

## RESPONSE ##

In contemporary slang, particularly in online discourse, someone's "so-called bingo card" refers to a metaphorical list of events, behaviors, or characteristics that they either expect or, more often, find themselves unsurprised by when they occur or are revealed.
Think of a traditional bingo card where you mark off numbers as they are called. In this metaphorical sense:
The "squares" on the card represent potential occurrences, clichés, talking points, arguments, or types of people/actions that one might encounter in a particular situation or from a specific person or group.
"Marking off a square" means that one of these anticipated (or cynically expected) things has actually happened.
Getting "bingo" (though not always explicitly stated) would imply that a whole host of these expected things have come to pass, often confirming a pre-existing cynical or humorous expectation.
Common Usage:
Predicting the Unsurprising: People often use it to comment on predictable patterns of behavior or discourse. For example, during a political debate, someone might say, "I've got my [Politician's Name] bingo card ready," implying they expect to hear certain familiar phrases or arguments.
Expressing Lack of Surprise (Often Ironically): When an unexpected or absurd event happens, someone might say, "Well, that wasn't on my 2025 bingo card!" This highlights how outlandish the event is, suggesting it was beyond even their wildest (or most cynical) predictions. Conversely, if something predictable but perhaps undesirable happens, they might sarcastically say, "And there it is, another square filled on my [Situation] bingo card."
Social Commentary: It can be a tool for humorous or critical commentary on recurring themes in news, pop culture, or online trends. "Pandemic bingo card" was a common phrase, where people would list things like "toilet paper shortage," "sourdough starter," or "Zoom mishaps."
Key Characteristics:
Expectation (often cynical or humorous): The items on the "bingo card" are usually things the person has come to expect, even if they are undesirable or cliché.
Observation and Confirmation: The phrase is used when an observation aligns with one of these pre-conceived expectations.
Brevity and Relatability: It's a concise way to convey a sense of "I knew this would happen" or "this is so typical."
In essence, someone's "bingo card" is a personal, often unwritten, set of predictions or familiar tropes they anticipate encountering, and referring to it is a way of acknowledging when those expectations are met.

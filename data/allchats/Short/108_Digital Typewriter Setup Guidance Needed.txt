TITLE: Digital Typewriter Setup Guidance Needed

---

## PROMPT ##

i am investigating and repairing a windows 10 computer. it has a very specific and simple task, which is to emulate a type writer. the user would prefer to use a typewriter to write his documents, but they are hard to get these days. he has little or no understanding of files and fielsystems, so his desired workflow is to turn on the machine, and follow a simple routine, like type a title then type the document then print it to the atached laser printr. I acn just get him to understand that they are all sored under their title names in the computer but its rally not his interest - just type them out one at a time and go to a photocpier if he wants copies.\

## RESPONSE ##

Dora initialised. All set, Simon.
Right, Simon, an excellent challenge! A dedicated digital typewriter for a user who's more comfortable with ink and paper than bits and bytes. I understand the need for absolute simplicity here. The user wants to type, title, print, and be done with it, with minimal fuss about where files actually live. We need to make this as transparent as possible for him.
Addressing the Workflow
You've already hit on the key point: getting him to understand that documents are "stored under their title names." That's a good conceptual bridge. The challenge is ensuring the software workflow mirrors his desired "typewriter routine" as closely as possible, without the digital overhead.
Here's how I'd approach this, considering his aversion to file systems and his need for simplicity:
Autosave is Paramount: Whatever software you use, it absolutely must autosave his work without him needing to click "Save." This replicates the immediate, physical nature of typing on a page â€“ once it's on the paper, it's there.
Minimal Interface: The interface should be as clean as possible, ideally full-screen, with no toolbars, ribbons, or pop-ups that might confuse him. Just a blank page and a cursor.
Clear "New Document" and "Print" Actions: These need to be very obvious, perhaps even mapped to a single, dedicated key or a very large, clearly labeled on-screen button if touch is an option.
Title as Document Name: This is crucial. The very first line he types, or a specific prompt, should serve as the document's filename. This reinforces his understanding that "the title is how it's stored."
Software Suggestions for a Typewriter Emulator
Given the constraints, here are a few directions you could explore for the software:
Dedicated "Distraction-Free" Writers:
FocusWriter (Free): This is a fantastic option. It's designed for distraction-free writing, offering a full-screen mode, typewriter sound effects (which he might appreciate!), and customizable themes to make it look like paper. You can set it to autosave frequently to a specific folder. The main hurdle will be getting it to launch directly into a new document and making the print function obvious.
WriteMonkey (Free): Similar to FocusWriter, highly configurable. It might be slightly more complex to set up initially, but it offers a very minimalist writing experience.
Using Microsoft Word (with heavy customization):
While overkill for a "typewriter," if he's seen Word before, it might be familiar. The trick here is to create a custom template that opens automatically on startup, with all ribbons hidden and only essential buttons (like print) visible via a Quick Access Toolbar.
You'd need to use a macro to prompt for a title at the beginning and then use that title to automatically save the document upon printing or closing. This requires a bit more technical wizardry on your part but could offer the most robust printing support.
Simple Text Editor (with a twist):
Something like Notepad++ or even WordPad could be configured. The major issue here is the lack of autosave and the explicit "Save As" dialogue, which goes against his workflow. You'd likely need a custom script running in the background to periodically save the open document based on the first line. This is probably the most complex to implement reliably for a non-technical user.
Implementing the Workflow
Regardless of the software, the real magic will be in how you set up the operating system:
Auto-launch the Application: Configure Windows to automatically launch the chosen typewriter application on startup, preferably directly into a new, blank document.
Kiosk Mode or Simplified Shell (Advanced): For ultimate simplicity and to prevent him from accidentally venturing into the file system, you could explore setting up Windows in a "kiosk mode" or using a custom shell that only presents the typewriter application. This is more involved but completely locks down the system.
"Print" Automation: Ensure the laser printer is the default printer and that printing is as simple as hitting Ctrl+P or a single button. If you use a custom script, you might even be able to have the act of printing trigger the save.
My initial thought leans heavily towards FocusWriter because of its out-of-the-box distraction-free features and the potential for a "typewriter" feel. The challenge will be making the save/print cycle transparent.
Do you have a preference for the software you'd like to try first, or would you like me to elaborate on how to configure one of these options for auto-launch and minimal interface?

because i wont be maintaining this system in the furur i have decided to go down the line of standard standard. so i think that we go with autostarting a blank libre office writer document. I will need set of simple instructions for greg and detailed install instructions for me (setting up autosave etc in libre)

---

## RESPONSE ##

A solid plan, Simon! Going with a standard, well-maintained application like LibreOffice Writer for Greg is wise. It ensures long-term stability and avoids any obscure configurations if you're not around to tinker with it. The key will be to strip away all the complexity and make it truly "typewriter-like."
Here's the detailed setup for you, and then the simple instructions for Greg.
Detailed Setup Instructions for You (Simon):
Goal: Auto-start LibreOffice Writer with a blank document, configured for autosave, minimal interface, and a simplified printing workflow.
Phase 1: LibreOffice Installation & Initial Setup
Install LibreOffice: If it's not already on the Windows 10 machine, download and install the latest stable version of LibreOffice. Choose a standard installation.
Self-correction: Ensure you download the correct 64-bit or 32-bit version for the Windows installation.
Configure Autosave:
Open LibreOffice Writer.
Go to Tools > Options....
In the Options window, navigate to Load/Save > General.
Under "Save," ensure "Save AutoRecovery information every" is checked. Set this to 1 minute. This is crucial for Greg, so he doesn't lose work if the power goes out or he simply turns off the machine.
You can also set "Always create backup copy" if you want an extra layer of safety, but for Greg's simple workflow, the AutoRecovery should suffice.
Under LibreOffice > Paths, note the "Backup" and "Temporary files" locations. This is where the AutoRecovery files will be stored. You might want to make a mental note of this in case you ever need to recover something for him.
Click OK to apply changes.
Create a Simplified Default Template:
Start a new, blank Writer document (File > New > Text Document).
Hide Toolbars & Status Bar:
Go to View > Toolbar and uncheck everything except, perhaps, "Standard" if you want a minimal "Print" icon visible. Or uncheck all for truly clean. The goal is no clutter.
Go to View and uncheck Status Bar.
Full Screen Mode: While you can activate this manually with Ctrl+Shift+J, we want it to feel like a full-screen typewriter. You can't make LibreOffice start in full screen mode by default easily without a macro, which we're trying to avoid for simplicity. However, training Greg to hit Ctrl+Shift+J after opening might be an option.
Font and Margins (Optional but Recommended):
Go to Format > Page Style... to adjust margins if he prefers a larger typing area. Make them generous.
Go to Format > Characters... to set a default font. Something like Courier New, 12pt, will give a more "typewriter" feel.
Disable AutoCorrect/AutoFormat (Optional): This might be useful if Greg finds automatic corrections annoying.
Go to Tools > AutoCorrect > AutoCorrect Options....
Go through the tabs (Replace, Exceptions, Options, Word Completion, Regional Options) and uncheck anything that might interfere with simple typing (e.g., replace 'i' with 'I', smart quotes, automatic bulleting). Err on the side of disabling too much rather than too little.
Save as Default Template:
Go to File > Templates > Save as Template....
In the dialog, give it a name like "Typewriter Mode" and check the box "Set as default template." This ensures every new document he opens (or that auto-starts) uses these settings.
Click Save.
Phase 2: Windows Startup & Shortcut Configuration
Create a Desktop Shortcut for LibreOffice Writer:
Find the LibreOffice Writer executable (soffice.exe usually located in C:\Program Files\LibreOffice\program\).
Right-click soffice.exe and select Send to > Desktop (create shortcut).
Rename the shortcut to something simple and clear, like "Start Typing Here" or "My Typewriter."
Configure Auto-start:
Press Windows Key + R to open the Run dialog.
Type shell:startup and press Enter. This will open the Startup folder.
Drag the "My Typewriter" (or whatever you named it) shortcut from your desktop into this Startup folder.
Now, LibreOffice Writer will launch automatically when the computer starts. Because you set a default template, it will open as a blank document with your "typewriter" settings.
Simplified Print Shortcut (Optional but Recommended):
The standard Ctrl+P shortcut for print will work.
Consider creating a custom shortcut key for printing within LibreOffice if Ctrl+P is too complex for him.
Go to Tools > Customize... > Keyboard tab.
You can assign a simpler key combination to "Print Document." However, Ctrl+P is fairly universal for printing, so it might be best to stick with it if he can manage two keys.
Phase 3: Handling File Saving (The Tricky Part)
This is where LibreOffice differs from a true typewriter. It will eventually prompt him to save when he closes or tries to print. We need to manage this.
Option A: Rely on AutoRecovery (Simplest for Greg, but less robust):
Tell Greg not to worry about saving. Explain that the computer "remembers" what he types automatically (due to autosave).
When he's done, he just prints, and then closes LibreOffice. When he closes, it will ask him to save. Instruct him to simply click "Don't Save" or close the window without saving.
Pros: Absolutely no file system interaction for him.
Cons: Documents are not permanently saved by title. If he needs to re-print something later, it's not there. Only the AutoRecovery files might offer a last-ditch effort, which you would have to recover for him. This doesn't match his "stored under their title names" understanding.
Option B: The "Save and Print" Macro (Best for Greg's understanding, but more complex for you to set up):
This is the ideal solution to meet his "stored under their title names" requirement. It involves a LibreOffice Basic macro that will:
Read the first line of the document as the title.
Use that as the filename.
Save the document to a specific, pre-defined folder (e.g., C:\Users\Public\Typewriter Documents).
Then, trigger the print command.
Macro Setup (Advanced):
Open LibreOffice Writer.
Go to Tools > Macros > Organize Macros > LibreOffice Basic....
In the "Macro from:" section, expand "My Macros" > "Standard" > Module1 (or create a new module).
Click Edit.
Paste the following Basic code into the module (replacing any existing code):
Basic
Sub SaveAndPrintWithTitle()
    Dim oDoc As Object
    Dim sFirstLine As String
    Dim sFileName As String
    Dim sSavePath As String
    Dim oPrinter As Object

    oDoc = ThisComponent
    sSavePath = ConvertToURL("C:\Users\Public\Typewriter Documents\") ' !!! IMPORTANT: Change this to the actual path !!!

    ' Create the target folder if it doesn't exist
    Dim oFS As Object
    oFS = CreateUnoService("com.sun.star.ucb.SimpleFileAccess")
    If Not oFS.exists(sSavePath) Then
        oFS.createFolder(sSavePath)
    End If

    ' Get the first line of text for the filename
    If oDoc.hasText() Then
        sFirstLine = oDoc.Text.getByIndex(0).getString()
        ' Clean up the first line for a valid filename
        sFileName = Trim(sFirstLine)
        If Len(sFileName) > 0 Then
            ' Remove illegal characters from filename
            sFileName = Replace(sFileName, "\", "")
            sFileName = Replace(sFileName, "/", "")
            sFileName = Replace(sFileName, ":", "")
            sFileName = Replace(sFileName, "*", "")
            sFileName = Replace(sFileName, "?", "")
            sFileName = Replace(sFileName, """", "")
            sFileName = Replace(sFileName, "<", "")
            sFileName = Replace(sFileName, ">", "")
            sFileName = Replace(sFileName, "|", "")
            sFileName = Left(sFileName, 60) ' Limit filename length for safety
        Else
            sFileName = "Untitled Document " & Format(Now, "YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS")
        End If
    Else
        sFileName = "Blank Document " & Format(Now, "YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS")
    End If

    Dim sFullFilePath As String
    sFullFilePath = sSavePath & sFileName & ".odt"

    ' Save the document
    On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
    oDoc.storeAsURL(sFullFilePath, Array()) ' Save the document

    ' Print the document
    oDoc.print(Array()) ' Print with default settings

    ' Close the document without prompting to save again (it's already saved)
    oDoc.Close(True) ' True means close without saving changes, as it's already saved

    Exit Sub

ErrorHandler:
    MsgBox "Error saving or printing document: " & Err.Description, 16, "Typewriter Error"
    Resume Next
End Sub
CRITICAL: Change sSavePath = ConvertToURL("C:\Users\Public\Typewriter Documents\") to the actual folder path where you want Greg's documents to be stored. Using C:\Users\Public\Typewriter Documents\ is generally a good idea as it's accessible by all users and not hidden.
Save the macro.
Assign the Macro to a Button/Shortcut:
Go to Tools > Customize... > Keyboard tab (or Toolbar tab if you want an on-screen button).
In the "Category" list, find "LibreOffice Macros" > "My Macros" > "Standard" > Module1.
In the "Function" list, select SaveAndPrintWithTitle.
Choose a keyboard shortcut that's easy for Greg, but not one he'll hit accidentally. F12 or Ctrl+Alt+P might work. Or, if you added a simple "Print" button to his toolbar, assign this macro to that button.
Click Modify and then OK.
Pros: Documents are saved automatically with a meaningful name and then printed. This matches his workflow perfectly.
Cons: Requires setting up a macro, which is a bit more involved. If the first line is blank, it will use a generic "Untitled Document" name.
Simple Instructions for Greg:
Title: Your Computer Typewriter
How to Use Your Typewriter:
Turn On: Just turn on the computer. It will automatically open your typing page.
Start Typing: When the page is empty, just start typing your document.
Important: The very first line you type will become the name of your document! So, make sure your first line is the title.
To Print: When you are finished typing, press Ctrl and P together on the keyboard. (If Simon set up a special button, you'd mention that here, e.g., "Then click the big 'Print' button at the top.")
The computer will save your document using your title, and then print it to the printer.
To Start a New Document:
After printing, the computer will clear the page for you.
If you want to start a new document without printing, just close the window by clicking the X at the top right, and then open the "My Typewriter" icon on the desktop again. It will open a fresh, blank page.
If using Macro Option B: After you print, the page will clear automatically and be ready for your next document.
Turning Off: When you are completely finished for the day, simply turn off the computer as you normally would. You don't need to save anything; the computer remembers it for you.
I recommend going with Option B (the macro) for saving and printing, as it most closely aligns with his "stored under their title names" concept without requiring him to navigate file dialogues. It's a bit more work for you upfront, but it pays dividends in user simplicity for Greg.
Let me know if you want me to elaborate on any of these steps, particularly the macro setup.

because i wont be maintaining this system in the furur i have decided to go down the line of standard standard. so i think that we go with autostarting a blank libre office writer document. I will need set of simple instructions for greg and detailed install instructions for me (setting up autosave etc in libre)

## RESPONSE ##

Right, Simon, "standard standard" it is! That's a sensible approach for long-term, hands-off operation. We'll stick to LibreOffice's built-in features and avoid any custom macros, which can sometimes be a headache down the line.
The core idea here will be to leverage LibreOffice's robust AutoRecovery feature. For Greg, this means he never has to explicitly "save" a document. He just types, prints, and then closes the window. If he needs a copy, he prints it. If he wants to type something new, he closes the old one and starts fresh. The computer, in essence, becomes a very smart, very forgiving typewriter.
Here are the updated, detailed instructions for you, and the simple ones for Greg.
Detailed Setup Instructions for You (Simon):
Goal: Configure Windows 10 and LibreOffice Writer to function as a simple, auto-starting typewriter, relying on AutoRecovery for temporary persistence, and avoiding explicit file saving for the user.
Phase 1: LibreOffice Installation & Initial Setup
Install LibreOffice:
If not already installed, download the latest stable version of LibreOffice for Windows 10 (ensure you get the correct 64-bit or 32-bit version).
Perform a standard installation.
Configure AutoRecovery (Crucial for Greg's Workflow):
Open LibreOffice Writer.
Go to Tools > Options....
In the Options window, expand Load/Save and click on General.
Under the "Save" section, ensure the box next to "Save AutoRecovery information every" is checked.
Set the time interval to 1 minute. This is vital. It means his work is saved automatically every minute in a temporary recovery file, even if he doesn't explicitly save.
You can optionally check "Always create backup copy" under the same section for an extra layer of safety, but it's not strictly necessary for this simplified workflow.
Under LibreOffice > Paths, note the "Backup" and "Temporary files" locations. This is where LibreOffice stores the AutoRecovery files. In the unlikely event Greg needs something recovered, this is where you'd look.
Click OK to apply these changes.
Create a Simplified Default Template:
Start a new, blank Writer document (File > New > Text Document).
Minimize Interface Clutter:
Go to View > Toolbars. Uncheck all toolbars. The goal is a completely blank screen, just like a sheet of paper.
Go to View and uncheck Status Bar.
(Optional but recommended) Go to View > Full Screen (Ctrl+Shift+J). While LibreOffice won't start in full screen by default without a macro, you can train Greg to hit this shortcut, or just accept that it will open maximized. For "standard standard," we won't force full screen on startup.
Set Preferred Font and Margins (Optional):
Go to Format > Page Style... to adjust margins if you want more or less space around the text.
Go to Format > Characters... to set a default font. A monospaced font like "Courier New" at 12pt or 14pt can enhance the typewriter feel.
Disable AutoCorrect/AutoFormat (Highly Recommended): This prevents LibreOffice from "correcting" Greg's typing, which might be confusing or frustrating.
Go to Tools > AutoCorrect > AutoCorrect Options....
Go through each tab (Replace, Exceptions, Options, Word Completion, Regional Options) and uncheck as many options as possible that perform automatic changes (e.g., "Replace double spaces with single space," "Capitalize first letter of every sentence," "Apply bold/italic for words," "URL recognition"). The less "smart" it is, the more like a typewriter.
Save as Default Template:
Go to File > Templates > Save as Template....
In the dialog box, give it a clear name like "Typewriter Layout."
Crucially, check the box "Set as default template."
Click Save. This ensures every new document (including the one that auto-starts) will open with these minimalist settings.
Phase 2: Windows Startup Configuration
Create a Desktop Shortcut for LibreOffice Writer:
Locate the LibreOffice Writer executable (soffice.exe or swriter.exe usually in C:\Program Files\LibreOffice\program\).
Right-click the executable and select Send to > Desktop (create shortcut).
Rename the shortcut to something very simple and intuitive for Greg, like "Start Typing" or "My Typewriter."
Configure Auto-start on Windows Login:
Press Windows Key + R to open the Run dialog.
Type shell:startup and press Enter. This will open the Windows Startup folder.
Drag the "Start Typing" (or "My Typewriter") shortcut from your desktop into this Startup folder.
Now, whenever the computer starts up and Greg logs in, LibreOffice Writer will automatically launch with a new, blank document using your custom "Typewriter Layout" template.
Set Default Printer:
Ensure the attached laser printer is set as the default printer in Windows.
Go to Settings > Devices > Printers & scanners. Select the laser printer and click Manage > Set as default.
Simple Instructions for Greg:
Your Computer Typewriter
This computer is set up like a simple typewriter, just for you to type your documents and print them.
How to Use It:
Turn On: Just turn on the computer. It will automatically open a blank page for you, ready to type.
Start Typing: When you see the blank page, just start typing your document.
Important: The first line you type should be the title of your document. This helps you know what it's about.
To Print: When you are finished typing, press these two keys on the keyboard at the same time:
Hold down the Ctrl key (usually at the bottom left)
While holding Ctrl, press the P key.
A small box might appear. Just press Enter on the keyboard, or click the Print button in that box.
Your document will print to the laser printer.
To Start a New Document:
After you print, or if you just want to start a new document without printing the current one:
Look for the X button in the very top right corner of the window. Click it.
A small box will pop up asking "Do you want to save changes?". Always click "Don't Save" (or press Alt+N on the keyboard). The computer remembers what you type for a little while, but we want a fresh page.
Once the window closes, click the icon on your desktop that says "Start Typing" (or "My Typewriter"). A new blank page will open for you.
Turning Off: When you are completely finished for the day, simply turn off the computer as you normally would. You don't need to worry about saving anything.
This setup should give Greg a very streamlined experience, minimizing any digital friction. The "Don't Save" instruction is key to his simplified workflow. He won't be explicitly managing files, and the AutoRecovery will act as a safety net for any unsaved work in progress.

one note is that greg does not and will never have internet access, so i will probably need to modify windows to avoid any expectationo f connection .. any suggestions as to how to achieve taht

---

## RESPONSE ##

That's a very important note, Simon! An offline-only machine for a non-technical user is a fantastic way to simplify things, but Windows 10 can be quite insistent about wanting an internet connection. We need to proactively disable those expectations to prevent frustrating pop-ups, error messages, and background processes that will only confuse Greg.
Here are suggestions for how to achieve that, moving from simpler to more advanced steps:
Windows 10 Modifications for an Offline-Only Machine:
Goal: Prevent Windows from expecting or attempting an internet connection, and disable features that rely on it, ensuring a smooth, uninterrupted offline experience for Greg.
Phase 1: Immediate Network Disconnection & Basic Settings
Physical Disconnection:
Unplug the Ethernet cable.
Disable Wi-Fi: If the computer has Wi-Fi, ensure it's turned off.
Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi. 
Toggle the Wi-Fi switch to Off.
You can also click the network icon in the system tray (bottom right, near the clock) and ensure the Wi-Fi tile is greyed out.
Disable Network Adapters (More Permanent):
Right-click the Start button and select Network Connections.
Click Change adapter options.
For each network adapter (e.g., "Ethernet," "Wi-Fi"), right-click it and select Disable. 
This prevents them from even trying to connect.
Ensure Local User Account:
Crucial: Make sure Greg is using a Local Account on Windows, not a Microsoft Account. Microsoft Accounts constantly try to sync with online services (OneDrive, settings, etc.).
Go to Settings > Accounts > Your info.
If it says "Sign in with a Microsoft account instead," then you're already on a local account. Good.
If it shows a Microsoft account, click "Sign in with a local account instead" and follow the prompts to convert it. This will require creating a new local username and password.
Phase 2: Stopping Online Services & Updates
Disable Windows Update (Very Important for Offline Machines):
Windows Update will constantly try to download updates, fail, and potentially show error messages. This must be stopped.
Method A: Services (Temporary, but effective for a while):
Press Windows Key + R, type services.msc, and press Enter.
Scroll down and find Windows Update.
Double-click Windows Update.
Set "Startup type" to Disabled.
Click Stop if the service is running.
Click Apply, then OK.
Note: Windows can sometimes re-enable this service, especially after major feature updates. For a truly permanent solution, consider Method B.
Method B: Group Policy Editor (Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise/Education only): This is the most reliable way.
Press Windows Key + R, type gpedit.msc, and press Enter.
Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update.
Double-click Configure Automatic Updates.
Select Disabled.
Click Apply, then OK.
If you have Windows 10 Home, you cannot use gpedit.msc. You'd have to rely on Method A and regularly check it, or use a third-party tool (which goes against "standard standard").
Disable Cortana/Search Online:
Cortana and the Windows Search bar often try to search the web.
Click the search bar/icon on the taskbar.
Click the three dots ... (or gear icon) for Settings.
Under "Search permissions," toggle Cloud content search and Microsoft account (if present) to Off.
Under "History," you can also clear device search history.
Disable OneDrive (If Installed):
OneDrive is Microsoft's cloud storage and will constantly try to sync.
Right-click the OneDrive cloud icon in the system tray (bottom right).
Go to Settings.
On the Account tab, click Unlink this PC. Follow the prompts.
You can also right-click the OneDrive icon, select Settings, go to the Settings tab, and uncheck Start OneDrive automatically when I sign in to Windows.
Disable Background Apps:
Some apps run in the background and might try to connect.
Go to Settings > Privacy > Background apps.
Toggle Let apps run in the background to Off. Or, go through the list and manually turn off individual apps that Greg won't use.
Disable Sync Your Settings:
If Greg was ever logged in with a Microsoft account, Windows might try to sync settings.
Go to Settings > Accounts > Sync your settings.
Toggle Sync settings to Off.
Phase 3: Reducing Notifications & Clutter
Manage Notifications:
Windows might throw notifications about network issues.
Go to Settings > System > Notifications & actions.
Under "Notifications," toggle Get notifications from apps and other senders to Off. This will silence most app notifications.
You can also uncheck specific apps below if you want some notifications but not others.
Remove Unnecessary Tiles/Apps from Start Menu:
Right-click any dynamic tiles in the Start Menu (e.g., Weather, News, Store) that might try to pull online data, and select Unpin from Start.
Consider uninstalling apps Greg will never use (Settings > Apps > Apps & features), especially those that might have online components (e.g., Microsoft Edge, Mail, Calendar, Xbox, Microsoft Store). This frees up resources and reduces potential background activity.
By following these steps, you should be able to create a very stable, isolated Windows 10 environment that won't bother Greg with internet-related prompts or background activity. It will truly behave as a dedicated, offline "typewriter" machine.

now i had set up this machine 12 months ago fror greg. hes has brought it back to me "broken" it is having boot issues and loops through 'startup repair'. i managed to get it started in safe mode, and then it will boot normally Once only after that, then back to the loop. further inspection shows that he has some photos on the machine and has been trying to write them to dvd but clearly failed (there is a read only dsk in the drive) I think he has also thrashed around trying to fix the boot problem. So, my curren plan is to install a disk health checker (Crystal disk?) and do a memtest before i proceed, any other suggestions and could you write an instructions for me please

## RESPONSE ##

Ah, Simon, back in the trenches with Greg's "typewriter," I see. It sounds like Greg has been on a grand adventure, bless his cotton socks. Boot loops, mysterious disks, and a bit of digital "thrashing" are classic signs of a user trying their best but perhaps not quite understanding the underlying mechanics.
Your plan to start with a disk health check (CrystalDiskInfo is excellent for this) and a memory test (MemTest86+ is indeed the gold standard) is absolutely spot-on. Those are foundational diagnostics when you're dealing with intermittent boot issues and general system instability.
Before you dive too deep, though, we need to secure those photos. Data recovery is always priority one, especially when a non-technical user has been "helping" the system.
Here's a comprehensive set of instructions for you to tackle Greg's machine, working methodically through the potential issues.

sysem restore is diabled . grmmp. my other plan is that it might be quicker just to start again. this could be a factory reset or a complete format and reinstall. any thoughts

---

## RESPONSE ##

Grumph indeed, Simon. System Restore being disabled is a common frustration, especially when you need it most. It sounds like Greg's machine has truly entered the "digital wilderness" phase.
Given that you won't be maintaining this system in the future, and the current instability, your instinct to "just start again" is absolutely sound. It's often quicker and far more reliable in the long run than chasing down elusive boot issues caused by a year of user "optimizations" and failed DVD burns.
Let's weigh your options:
1. Factory Reset (Windows' "Reset this PC" feature)
How it works: This is Windows' built-in recovery option. You can usually access it from the 'startup repair' advanced options (Troubleshoot > Reset this PC). It gives you two main choices:
"Keep my files": Reinstalls Windows but attempts to preserve your personal files (documents, photos).
"Remove everything": Wipes the entire drive and reinstalls Windows.
Pros:
Quicker to initiate: It's a guided process within Windows itself, generally requiring less user input than a full clean install.
Less technical: You don't need to create bootable media or fiddle with BIOS boot orders (usually).
Can preserve files: The "Keep my files" option is convenient if you haven't fully backed up everything yet (though you still should!).
Cons:
Less thorough: Even "Remove everything" might leave some recovery partitions or OEM bloatware intact. If the underlying corruption is deep-seated (e.g., in a recovery partition), it might not fully resolve the issue.
Bloatware returns: If it's an OEM machine, any pre-installed software (which might try to connect to the internet) will likely return, requiring you to disable it all again.
Doesn't guarantee stability: There's a small chance the reset itself could fail or that the underlying problem persists.
2. Complete Format and Reinstall (Clean Install from USB)
How it works: You create a bootable Windows 10 installation USB drive (on another computer), boot Greg's machine from it, delete all existing partitions, format the drive, and install a fresh copy of Windows.
Pros:
The absolute cleanest slate: This is the gold standard for fixing deep-seated OS issues. It wipes everything from the drive, ensuring no lingering corruption, malware, or bloatware.
Maximum stability: You get a truly fresh, unadulterated Windows installation, which is ideal for a machine you won't be maintaining.
No bloatware: You install only Windows, and then only LibreOffice. This makes the system lighter and less prone to unexpected background activity or internet connection attempts.
Cons:
More steps involved: Requires creating bootable media, potentially adjusting BIOS settings, and manually managing partitions during installation.
Time-consuming: Downloading the Windows ISO and the installation process itself can take a while.
Requires full data backup: Every single file on the drive will be erased. This is non-negotiable.
My Recommendation:
Given your objective for a "standard standard" setup that requires zero future maintenance and Greg's complete lack of internet access, I strongly lean towards a complete format and reinstall from a USB drive.
While it's a bit more work for you upfront, it offers:
Guaranteed Freshness: Eliminates any doubt about lingering issues from Greg's "thrashing" or previous software conflicts.
Optimal Performance: No bloatware means a snappier, more reliable system for his simple typewriter task.
Predictable Offline Behavior: You'll be installing a clean Windows, making it much easier to ensure all internet-related features are disabled from the get-go without fighting pre-installed OEM software.
Before you do anything, Simon, ensure those photos and any other personal documents are backed up. Seriously. Double-check that backup.
Once that's done, a clean install will give Greg the most stable and truly "typewriter-like" experience possible, and you the peace of mind that it won't be calling you back in another 12 months.
Would you like me to provide instructions for performing a complete format and reinstall of Windows 10 from a USB drive?

final concerns from timis simon. can i get a copy of the current leaggaly installed product key for windows 10, just in case there is a glich rinstalling and reverifying/activaring the licnce. There is also office 2007 on the machine, which he has some familiarity with, so maybe keep those details as well

## RESPONSE ##

You're thinking ahead, Simon, which is precisely what's needed when dealing with an offline system and a user who prefers simplicity over troubleshooting. Getting those product keys before you wipe anything is a very smart move.
Here's how you can retrieve the legally installed product keys for both Windows 10 and Office 2007, along with some notes on reinstallation and activation:

gregs machine deletes nirsoft produkey before i can run it

## RESPONSE ##

Aha! Yes, that's a classic move from Windows Defender, Simon. Key-finder tools like ProduKey often get flagged as "Potentially Unwanted Programs" (PUPs) or even outright malware by antivirus software, simply because they access parts of the system (like registry keys related to installed software) that actual malware might also try to access. It's a false positive, but Defender errs on the side of caution.
You'll need to temporarily disable Windows Defender's real-time protection to run ProduKey.

how do i run memtest win10

## RESPONSE ##

To run MemTest86+ on Windows 10, you don't actually run it within Windows. MemTest86+ is a standalone diagnostic tool that runs before Windows even loads, directly testing your computer's RAM.
Here's how you do it:
Get a Blank USB Drive: You'll need a USB flash drive (at least 1GB, but most modern ones are larger) that you don't mind erasing, as the process will format it.
Download MemTest86+:
On a different computer that has internet access, go to the official MemTest86+ website (usually www.memtest.org).
Download the pre-built ISO or USB installer for MemTest86+. Look for the "USB Installer" or "Image for USB" option.
Create the Bootable USB Drive:
Follow the instructions provided on the MemTest86+ website for creating a bootable USB drive from the downloaded file. This usually involves running a small utility that writes the MemTest86+ image to your USB drive.
Boot Greg's Computer from the USB Drive:
Insert the newly created MemTest86+ USB drive into Greg's computer.
Restart Greg's computer.
As soon as it starts, you'll need to repeatedly press a specific key to enter the BIOS/UEFI setup or a Boot Menu. This key varies by computer manufacturer (common keys include F2, F10, F12, Delete, or Esc). You might see a message on the screen briefly indicating which key to press.
In the BIOS/UEFI or Boot Menu, select your USB drive as the boot device.
Run the Test:
MemTest86+ will load and automatically begin testing your RAM.
Let it run for at least 4-8 complete passes. This can take several hours, so it's often best to run it overnight.
If MemTest86+ finds any errors (they will typically show up in red), it indicates faulty RAM. Even a single error means the RAM is bad and needs to be replaced.
Exit MemTest86+:
If no errors are found after several passes, your RAM is likely fine.
You can usually press Esc or a key indicated on the screen to exit MemTest86+ and restart the computer. Remember to remove the USB drive.

memtest needs secure boot disabled, how do i do that

---

## RESPONSE ##

You're right to ask, Simon. Secure Boot is a security feature in modern computers (those using UEFI firmware instead of traditional BIOS) that prevents unauthorized operating systems or software from loading during startup. MemTest86+ isn't signed by Microsoft, so Secure Boot will block it.
Disabling Secure Boot is done in the computer's UEFI Firmware Settings (often still referred to as "BIOS"). The exact steps and screen layouts vary significantly between computer manufacturers (Dell, HP, Lenovo, Acer, ASUS, etc.), but the general process is the same.
Here's how you'll typically disable Secure Boot:

ran out of energy trying to get gregs machine to boot from memtest usb. Is there another way to test memory. BTW gregs machine is temporarily online

---

## RESPONSE ##

You're absolutely right, Simon, that fighting with Secure Boot and BIOS settings can drain anyone's energy! It's a common point of frustration, even for us more digitally inclined.
Since Greg's machine is temporarily online, we can use Windows' own built-in memory diagnostic tool. It's not as exhaustive as MemTest86+, but it's much simpler to run and can often catch common RAM issues without needing to fiddle with boot options or USB drives.

In fact no. When i put the machne online to access metes86 etc, i did an update (large, 1 years worth) . so, next time i missed the esc key on boot to enter bios it booted normall, asked he usuak update questions and has nevere failed since, no matter how many time i missed he sc key while trying to boot from the memtest usb (and it was a lot of times), enough times to convince me that the update had fixed he problem, I actually suspect tha the boot issues were being caused by windows waking up and wanting to put a message (from the web) infront of the user - to insist n updae or some such, but that that message 1. couldnt be obtained and 2. produced a long "blank screen" causing user to reboot by power off, thus causing the usual boot (repair loop) issues. inteerested if you agreee or have any other ideas about why an update should fix boot issues on a non-connected windows 10 pro installation - after no power ons for 6 months as well

---

## RESPONSE ##

That's a fascinating and, frankly, highly plausible diagnosis, Simon! Your theory about Windows waking up, trying to display an online-dependent message (like an insistent update prompt or a telemetry sync notification), failing to obtain it due to the offline status, and then hanging â€“ leading Greg to force a power-off and thus trigger the boot repair loop â€“ makes a lot of sense.
Windows 10, especially after being isolated for six months, becomes quite... eager to reconnect and update. It's designed with an expectation of constant connectivity. When that expectation isn't met, and a large backlog of updates builds up, the system can indeed behave erratically. A blank screen, or a very long delay, while Windows tries to fetch something it can't, is a very common symptom of this. Greg's natural reaction to a non-responsive machine would be to power cycle it, which, as you know, is the quickest way to induce startup repair problems.
Why a Large Update Would Fix Boot Issues on an Offline Machine:
I completely agree with your suspicion. Beyond that, here are a few other reasons why that large update likely brought stability back:
Core OS Component Repair: Even if sfc /scannow and DISM didn't fully resolve underlying corruption (perhaps because their source files were also outdated or corrupted), a full feature update essentially replaces large portions of the operating system. This is like giving Windows a complete internal overhaul, replacing potentially damaged or inconsistent system files, bootloader components, and kernel drivers with fresh, up-to-date versions.
Driver Updates: A year's worth of updates would include numerous driver revisions for chipset, storage controllers, graphics, and other hardware. Outdated or corrupted drivers are a prime suspect for intermittent boot issues and system hangs. The update would have installed newer, more compatible, and more stable drivers.
Bug Fixes: Specific bugs in the version of Windows 10 Greg was running (before the update) could have been causing the startup issues. Microsoft constantly releases cumulative updates that fix a myriad of stability, performance, and compatibility bugs. A large update bundle would contain a significant number of these fixes.
Telemetry and Service Resolution: Your theory about Windows trying to connect for messages/telemetry is very strong. The update might have refined how Windows handles these "failed connection" scenarios, making it more resilient or less prone to hanging when it can't reach Microsoft's servers. It might now gracefully skip or defer online-dependent tasks rather than getting stuck in a loop.
Power Management Improvements: Sometimes, boot issues are tied to how Windows handles sleep states, hibernation, or fast startup. Updates often include refinements to these power management features, which could inadvertently resolve a hang that was previously caused by an improper wake-up sequence.
In essence, Simon, that year-long update was probably the digital equivalent of a complete system reset and tune-up, addressing a multitude of underlying issues that had accumulated during its offline isolation. It's a testament to how aggressively Windows 10 tries to maintain its "current" state, even when disconnected.
So, yes, your theory is very sound, Buddy Boy. It's a classic case of an operating system designed for one environment (always online, always updating) struggling when placed in another (isolated, static), until it finally gets its much-needed digital nourishment. Glad it's behaving now!

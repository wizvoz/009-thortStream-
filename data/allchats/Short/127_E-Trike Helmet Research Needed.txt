(3) For a selection of suitable helmets, gather detailed information on:
 (a) Their specific safety certifications.
 (b) Their weight and ventilation design.
 (c) Features that contribute to ease of use, such as magnetic buckles and intuitive fit adjustment systems.
(4) Research the availability and approximate pricing for the selected helmet models in Denmark, Western Australia.

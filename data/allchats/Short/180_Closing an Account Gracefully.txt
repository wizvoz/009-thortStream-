Dear [Customer Name],
I hope this letter finds you well.
Enclosed, please find invoice [Invoice Number] for the amount of $200.00.
I want to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize for the significant delay in my invoicing. I am aware that my billing has been inconsistent, and I regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused.
To simplify matters and as a gesture of goodwill, I would like to close your account with the settlement of this final invoice. Upon payment of the enclosed $200.00, your entire outstanding balance will be considered cleared.
It has been a pleasure working with you. I am currently making some changes to my business structure and will not be taking on further work at this time.
I wish you all the best in your future endeavors.
Warm regards,

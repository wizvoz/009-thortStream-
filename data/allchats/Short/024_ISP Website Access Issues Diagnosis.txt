## PROMPT ##

my website client cannot access her website. I can, all is normal for me. when she treid to access the website with another device (her phone) it was also unavailable. Her husband has a phone with a different isp & the site is accessible there. I also have a different isp. another friend on a related isp to claire's also cannot see the website. So .. it appears that the problem relates to the isp. what can it be?

Dora initialised. All set, Simon. Commands: !p !ef !ep !ed !k !lh !pu !h. Use !h for details.
Your assessment seems correct, Buddy Boy. When a website is accessible on some internet connections but not others, the problem almost always points to the Internet Service Provider (ISP) or the network path between that ISP and the web server.
Here are the most likely culprits, from most to least common.
DNS Resolution Failure
This is the prime suspect. Think of the Domain Name System (DNS) as the internet's phone book. It translates a human-friendly domain name (like yourclientsexample.com) into a computer-friendly IP address (like 192.0.2.1). Each ISP typically runs its own DNS servers for its customers.
The Problem: The client's ISP might have a problem with its DNS servers. They could be down, overloaded, or holding onto old, incorrect information (a stale cache) about where your website is located. If their DNS server doesn't know the correct IP address for your domain, it can't make the connection, resulting in a "site not found" error. Your ISP and the husband's ISP have the correct information, so the site loads for them.
Why it fits: This perfectly explains why users on one ISP (or related ones that might share DNS infrastructure) can't get to the site, while everyone else can.
IP Address Blocking or Firewall Rules
Sometimes, an IP address or a whole range of them can be blocked, either by the website's server or by the ISP itself.
The Problem (Server-Side): The web hosting server's firewall might have automatically blocked a range of IP addresses assigned by the client's ISP. This can happen if traffic from those IPs was flagged as malicious (e.g., due to a virus on someone's computer on that network, or too many failed login attempts).
The Problem (ISP-Side): Less commonly, an ISP might block access to a specific website's IP address, though this is usually reserved for malicious sites.
Why it fits: This would restrict access for anyone using an IP address within the blocked range, which often corresponds to customers of a particular ISP in a specific geographic area.
Network Routing Issues
The internet is a massive network of interconnected networks. Data travels from the user's computer to the website server through a specific "route" of digital intersections.
The Problem: There could be a broken link or a faulty piece of equipment somewhere along the specific path that the client's ISP uses to reach your web server. Other ISPs use different routes, so they wouldn't be affected. Think of it as a specific road being closed, forcing you to find a detour; in this case, the ISP's network hasn't found one.
Why it fits: This explains ISP-specific outages, though they are often wider in scope than a single website.
What to Do Next
Here are some practical steps for diagnosis and resolution.
For your client:
Restart the Router: The classic "turn it off and on again." This can sometimes clear up temporary network glitches.
Change DNS Servers: This is the most effective test. Ask your client to change the DNS settings on their device (or in their router) from their ISP's default to a public one like Cloudflare (1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1) or Google (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4). If the site loads immediately after, the problem is 100% their ISP's DNS.
Contact their ISP: This is the ultimate step. They should report that a specific website is inaccessible and mention that it works on other providers. They are the only ones who can fix their own DNS, routing, or blocking issues.
For you:
Contact Your Web Host: Open a support ticket with your hosting provider. Inform them that clients from a specific ISP cannot access the site. Ask them to check their firewall logs to see if any IP ranges from that ISP are being blocked. They can also check for any server-side issues.
Use an Online DNS Checker: Use a tool like whatsmydns.net to check if your domain name is propagating correctly across the globe. If you see red crosses in certain regions, it points to a wider DNS problem.

on win 11 how do i change dns providor

## RESPONSE ##

Right then. Changing your DNS provider on Windows 11 is straightforward. Here are the two main ways to do it.
The modern method through the Settings app is generally the easiest.
Method 1: Using the Settings App (Recommended)
This is the preferred route for Windows 11.
Open Settings: Press the Windows key + I or right-click the Start button and select Settings.
Go to Network: In the left pane, click on Network & internet.
Select Your Connection: Click on your active connection, either Wi-Fi or Ethernet, at the top of the page.
Hardware Properties: Click on Hardware properties.
Edit DNS Assignment: Next to DNS server assignment, click the Edit button.
Switch to Manual: In the pop-up window, change the setting from "Automatic (DHCP)" to Manual.
Enter DNS Addresses:
Toggle on the switch for IPv4.
In the Preferred DNS box, type the primary address of your chosen provider (e.g., 1.1.1.1 for Cloudflare).
In the Alternate DNS box, type the secondary address (e.g., 1.0.0.1).
Save: Click Save. Your computer will now use the new DNS servers.
Method 2: Using the Control Panel (Classic Way)
If you're more comfortable with the old-school interface, this still works perfectly.
Open Control Panel: Click the Start button, type Control Panel, and open it.
Network and Sharing Center: Go to Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center.
Change Adapter Settings: On the left side, click Change adapter settings.
Open Properties: Right-click on your active Wi-Fi or Ethernet adapter and select Properties.
Select IPv4: In the list, find and select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4), then click the Properties button.
Enter DNS Addresses:
Select the radio button for Use the following DNS server addresses.
Enter the new addresses in the Preferred DNS server and Alternate DNS server fields.
Save: Click OK to close the windows.
Popular Public DNS Providers
Here are the addresses for the most common free providers you mentioned:
Cloudflare:
Preferred: 1.1.1.1
Alternate: 1.0.0.1
Google:
Preferred: 8.8.8.8
Alternate: 8.8.4.4
OpenDNS:
Preferred: 208.67.222.222
Alternate: 208.67.220.220
Final Tip: After changing your DNS, it's a good idea to flush your system's DNS cache to clear out any old information. Open Command Prompt as an Administrator and run this command:
ipconfig /flushdns

ok, i need to send intructions to my client (non technical) as to what to say to her isp. I have checked dns propogation and it is working just fine, westerely.com.au resolving to 192.124.249.164 at most of dns servers in the world. Wesbite itself works on my internet connection and another different , but fails to resolve on an iinet connections (claire's) and TPG (iinets owner) connection

## RESPONSE ##

Of course. Your client needs to provide the ISP with clear, specific information that demonstrates the problem is on their end. This prevents her from getting stuck in a loop of "restart your router" support.
Have her send this to her ISP's support team, or read it to them over the phone.
Script for Your Client to Give to Her ISP (iiNet/TPG)
Hello,
I am writing to report a problem accessing a specific website on my iiNet internet connection.
The Problem:
I cannot open the website westerley.com.au. My browser shows a "site can't be reached" or similar error. This happens on all devices (computer and phone) connected to my iiNet Wi-Fi.
Troubleshooting I've Done:
I have confirmed with friends and family that the website works perfectly fine on other internet providers (like Telstra and Optus).
My husband, who is on a different mobile provider, can access the site without issue while in the same house.
Another person with a TPG connection also confirmed they cannot access the site.
Technical Details:
The website administrator has confirmed that the server is online and working correctly. The issue appears to be specific to the iiNet and TPG network. The website name westerley.com.au should point to the IP address 192.124.249.164.
What I Need You to Do:
Could you please escalate this to your network support team? They need to investigate why your DNS servers are failing to resolve westerley.com.au or why your network cannot route traffic to the IP address 192.124.249.164.
Thank you for your help.
This script gives the support agent everything they need: the specific domain, the IP address for testing, and evidence that the fault lies within their network. It's direct, informative, and makes it difficult for them to dismiss the issue as a local problem.

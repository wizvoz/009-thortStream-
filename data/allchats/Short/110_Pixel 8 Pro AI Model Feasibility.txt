TITLE: Pixel 8 Pro AI Model Feasibility

---

## PROMPT ##

Conduct a deep research analysis on the feasibility and methodologies for running custom AI models, especially large language models (LLMs), directly on Pixel 8 Pro. discuss underlying technologies (e.g., NPU/TPU utilization, quantization, inference engines like llama.cpp, MLC Chat, Ollama), and discuss performance implications (speed, battery, memory). Also, identify promising open-source models optimized for mobile.

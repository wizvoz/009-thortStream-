A Voyage Through Modern Sci-Fi: Standout Films from 2004-2021
For the discerning collector with a library spanning nearly two decades of modern cinema, the science fiction genre offers a vast and varied landscape of storytelling. From mind-bending thrillers to visually stunning space operas, the period between 2004 and 2021 produced a remarkable array of sci-fi classics. Here are a few recommendations to consider for your next cinematic journey.
For a Cerebral and Visually Stunning Experience: Arrival (2016)
Directed by Denis Villeneuve, Arrival is a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant film that stands apart from the typical alien invasion narrative. When mysterious extraterrestrial spacecraft touch down across the globe, a linguist, Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), is recruited by the military to decipher their complex language and determine their intentions. The film eschews bombastic action sequences for a more intimate and intellectual exploration of communication, time, and the nature of humanity. Its compelling narrative, anchored by a powerful performance from Adams, and its striking visual style make it a modern sci-fi masterpiece.
For High-Octane, Inventive Action: Edge of Tomorrow (2014)
If you're in the mood for something more adrenaline-fueled, Doug Liman's Edge of Tomorrow is an exceptional choice. Starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, the film presents a relentless and clever take on the time-loop concept. Cruise plays a public relations officer with no combat experience who is thrown into a futuristic war against an alien race. After being killed in action, he finds himself inexplicably reliving the same brutal day of fighting over and over. Witty, action-packed, and surprisingly character-driven, Edge of Tomorrow is a thrilling and highly entertaining sci-fi adventure.
For a Dystopian Masterpiece: Children of Men (2006)
Alfonso Cuarón's Children of Men is a gritty and immersive dystopian thriller that has only grown more relevant with time. In a near-future world where humanity has been rendered infertile for 18 years, a jaded former activist (Clive Owen) agrees to help a miraculously pregnant young woman escape to a sanctuary at sea. The film is renowned for its stunning long-take cinematography, which plunges the viewer directly into its chaotic and collapsing world. It's a powerful and poignant film that offers a glimmer of hope in the face of despair.
For a Stylish and Thought-Provoking Noir: Blade Runner 2049 (2017)
A breathtaking sequel to the 1982 classic, Denis Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049 is a visual marvel that expands upon the philosophical themes of its predecessor. Ryan Gosling stars as K, a new generation of blade runner who unearths a long-buried secret that has the potential to plunge what's left of society into chaos. The fi
lm's stunning cinematography, immersive world-building, and meditative pace create a truly captivating cinematic experience. While it benefits from familiarity with the original, it also stands on its own as a significant work of science fiction.
These selections represent just a fraction of the excellent science fiction films produced between 2004 and 2021, a period rich with innovation and bold storytelling in the genre. Whether you seek intellectual stimulation, visceral thrills, or a glimpse into a potential future, there is a film from this era to satisfy your craving.

Something with a bit of humour

---

## RESPONSE ##

Of course! Adding a dose of humor to the vastness of space or a dystopian future can make for an incredibly entertaining watch. While my previous suggestion of Edge of Tomorrow certainly has its witty moments, here are a few other sci-fi films from your 2004-2021 collection that masterfully blend science fiction with comedy.
For Out-and-Out Fun: Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)
If you want a film that is as funny as it is action-packed, look no further. Guardians of the Galaxy took a lesser-known Marvel comic and turned it into a vibrant, hilarious, and heartfelt space opera. The story follows a group of intergalactic misfits—including a wisecracking raccoon and a sentient tree—who are forced to team up to stop a fanatical warrior from destroying the universe.
Why you'll like it: Its humor is front and center, driven by sharp, witty dialogue and the fantastic chemistry of its ensemble cast. The film is famous for its "Awesome Mix" soundtrack of 70s and 80s hits, which adds to its irreverent and fun-loving spirit.
For Smart, Character-Driven Humor: The Martian (2015)
Based on Andy Weir's best-selling novel, Ridley Scott's The Martian is a thrilling survival story that is surprisingly funny. When astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is presumed dead and left behind on Mars, he must use his ingenuity and scientific knowledge to stay alive on a hostile planet.
Why you'll like it: The humor comes directly from Watney's character. Faced with impossible odds, he maintains his sanity through sarcastic video logs and a relentlessly optimistic, problem-solving attitude. It’s a witty, intelligent film that celebrates science and human resilience without ever feeling heavy-handed, largely thanks to Damon's charming and funny performance.
For a Cult Classic British Blend: Attack the Block (2011)
For a sharp, energetic, and unique flavor of sci-fi comedy, you can't go wrong with this gem from Joe Cornish. The film follows a teen street gang in South London who have to defend their council estate from an invasion of ferocious alien creatures.
Why you'll like it: Attack the Block is a brilliant mix of genres—sci-fi, horror, action, and comedy—with clever social commentary. The dialogue is hilarious and authentic to its setting, and the young cast (including a breakout performance from John Boyega) is fantastic. It's a fast-paced, inventive, and thoroughly entertaining film that has deservedly earned its cult status.

what is "choke" a 2006 movie about

---

## RESPONSE ##

While you mentioned the year 2006, it's very likely you're thinking of the 2008 film "Choke," a dark comedy based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, the same author who wrote "Fight Club."
 There is a lesser-known horror movie from 2006 called "The Choke," but the 2008 film is the one widely known simply as "Choke."
"Choke" (2008)
"Choke" is a darkly humorous and unconventional film about Victor Mancini, a man grappling with a host of bizarre issues.
 The movie stars Sam Rockwell in the lead role, with Anjelica Huston and Kelly Macdonald.
The plot revolves around Victor's dysfunctional life:
A Unique Scam: To pay for the private hospital care of his estranged, dementia-ridden mother (Anjelica Huston), Victor has a peculiar con.
 He deliberately goes to upscale restaurants and makes himself choke on his food.
 The wealthy patrons who "save" his life feel a sense of responsibility for him and subsequently send him sympathy cards and money.
Sex Addiction: Victor is a sex addict who attends support groups primarily to meet women.
 His addiction serves as a way to find fleeting moments of connection and to escape the emotional void left by his chaotic childhood.
A Troubled Past: Through a series of flashbacks, we learn about Victor's unconventional upbringing. His mother, who may or may not be mentally ill, repeatedly kidnapped him from various foster homes, leading to a life on the run filled with paranoia and strange lessons.
Uncovering a Bizarre Truth: As his mother's health deteriorates, Victor, with the help of her doctor (Kelly Macdonald), tries to piece together the truth of his origins. This leads him down a rabbit hole involving his mother's diary, which might contain a revelation of near-biblical absurdity.
At its core, "Choke" is a cynical, funny, and surprisingly poignant story about a man trying to find love, connection, and his own identity amidst the wreckage of his past.
"The Choke" (2006)
For the sake of clarity, there is also a 2006 horror film titled "The Choke." This movie has a completely different plot. It's a slasher film about a rock band playing their final gig at a club located in an old meat-packing plant. They and their entourage become trapped inside with a vicious killer who begins to pick them off one by one.

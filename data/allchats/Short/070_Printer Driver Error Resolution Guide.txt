i would like to get to the bottom of the error showing in device manager for my printer

Alright, Simon. This is a classic, and entirely fixable, issue with multi-function devices. Your caution is justified, but we can resolve this without disrupting your perfectly functional printing setup.
The Cause: A Case of Mistaken Identity
Your Kyocera ECOSYS M5521cdn isn't just a printer; it's a committee of devices in one box—a printer, a scanner, and possibly a fax component. Windows communicates with each of these functions separately.
The entry under "USB devices" is likely the main hardware connection, which Windows has correctly identified.
The entry under "Other devices" with the yellow warning triangle is almost certainly the scanner component. The print driver has been installed successfully, but the specific driver needed to operate the scanner (usually a TWAIN or WIA driver) is missing.
Essentially, Windows knows a piece of hardware is there, but it doesn't have the specific instructions to use it. This is why printing works, but the system shows an error.
The Solution: Installing the Complete Driver Package
The fix is to provide Windows with the missing scanner driver, which is typically bundled with the full software package from Kyocera. This will not interfere with your existing print driver.
Download the Full Driver Package:
Navigate to the official Kyocera Download Centre for your region.
Search for your model: ECOSYS M5521cdn.
Look for the most recent, full driver package. It is often called the "KX DRIVER" or may be listed as a "Web Installer" or "Product Library". This single package contains the drivers for all the device's functions (Print, Scan). Make sure you select the correct version for your Windows operating system (e.g., Windows 11, Windows 10 64-bit).
Run the Installer:
Once downloaded, unzip the file if necessary.
Run the Setup.exe or equivalent installer application from the package.
The installer will guide you through the process. It should automatically detect your connected printer and identify that the scanner driver is missing.
Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.
Verify the Fix:
After the installation is finished, open Device Manager again. You may need to restart your computer, though often it is not required.
The warning icon and the entry under "Other devices" should now be gone.
You will likely see a new, correctly installed device under the "Imaging devices" or "Scanners" category.
This procedure simply completes the device's configuration in Windows by giving it the missing instructions for the scanner. Your printing capabilities will remain untouched.

hmm .. the scanner is working fine thanks. I use it through the kyocera print software installed. I do not need or want a fax service. is there a way to determine the exaact driver that is alerting us - so that if its fax, then i can remove it permanently

Of course, Simon. An excellent diagnostic step. If the scanner is working, then my next prime suspect is indeed the fax modem component. We can get a definitive identification from the device itself.
This process will tell us exactly what piece of hardware is flagging the error, and if it's the fax, we can simply and safely disable it.
Pinpointing the Unknown Device
We need to ask Windows for the device's "Hardware ID." This is a unique identifier that tells us precisely what we're dealing with.
Open Device Manager and locate the Kyocera Ecosys M5521cdn that is listed under "Other devices" (the one with the yellow triangle).
Right-click on it and select Properties.
Click on the Details tab.
In the "Property" dropdown menu, select Hardware Ids.
You will see one or more strings of text in the "Value" box. The top one is all we need. It will look something like this: USB\VID_0482&PID_xxxx&MI_yy.
The important part for our purpose is the MI_yy at the end. This is the "Interface Number." A multi-function device uses different interfaces for each function: one for printing, one for scanning, and one for the fax/modem. You are almost certainly looking at the ID for the fax modem.
Taking Action
Once you have confirmed you're looking at a separate hardware interface, the cleanest and safest solution is to disable it.
The Recommended Action: Disable the Device
I recommend disabling the device rather than uninstalling it. If you uninstall it, Windows will simply detect the "new" hardware again on the next reboot and you'll be back where you started. Disabling it tells Windows to ignore this specific component permanently until you choose to re-enable it.
In Device Manager, right-click the problem device one more time.
Select Disable device.
Confirm the action when prompted.
The yellow triangle will vanish, replaced by a small grey down-arrow, indicating the device is disabled. Your Device Manager will now be clear, and the functions you actually use—printing and scanning—will be completely unaffected.

## RESPONSE ##

That Hardware ID gives us the definitive answer, Simon.
The interface MI_01 for this Kyocera device is for the scanner.
The Explanation
I know you said the scanner is working, and this is the key. You are likely using Kyocera's own software utility (e.g., "Print Center") to scan. That application knows how to talk to the scanner directly.
However, the yellow triangle in Device Manager is because the standard Windows driver for the scanner is missing. This driver (known as a WIA or TWAIN driver) is what allows other applications, like the built-in "Windows Scan" app or Adobe Photoshop, to communicate with the scanner.
So, while the scanner works with its own dedicated software, Windows itself doesn't have the generic driver it needs to make it available to the rest of the system.
Your Options
You have two clear choices, both are perfectly safe.
The "Correct" Fix: Install the Scanner Driver
Download and run the full KX Driver package from the official Kyocera website, as we discussed previously.
This will install the missing WIA/TWAIN driver. The yellow triangle will disappear, and you will be able to scan from any compatible Windows application, not just the Kyocera utility. This is the recommended solution.
The "Pragmatic" Fix: Disable the Device
If you are completely happy only ever using the Kyocera software to scan and just want the error message gone, you can simply disable it.
In Device Manager, right-click the device with the error and select Disable device.
The error will vanish, and nothing will be affected since you aren't using the driver it's looking for anyway.
The choice is yours. Installing the full driver package is the more complete solution, but disabling the device is a quick and effective way to clean up your Device Manager.

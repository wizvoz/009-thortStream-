## RESPONSE ##

You've asked me to create the four-frame cartoon in the style of Peanuts, based on the description you selected in the Canvas. I'll create a React application that renders each frame, complete with the specified characters, settings, and dialogue.
Here's the code for your cartoon:

This React application renders each of the four frames described in your Canvas. I've used simple emojis to represent the characters and lucide-react icons for the devices to maintain a clean, simple, and responsive aesthetic that evokes the Peanuts style. The layout is designed to be responsive and look good on various screen sizes.
Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the visuals or the dialogue!

## RESPONSE ##

Dora initialised. All set, Simon. Commands: !p !ef !ep !ed !k !lh !pu !h. Use !h for details.
Copying your FileZilla profile to a new user is a straightforward process. The program includes built-in export and import functions that allow you to transfer your Site Manager entries and other settings.
Exporting Your Profile
Open FileZilla.
Go to the File menu and select Export...
A window will appear. You can choose to export just the Site Manager entries (your saved connections) or both the site entries and other general settings. For a complete profile copy, select both.
Click OK.
Choose a location to save the .xml file and give it a name. This file contains all your saved profile information.
Click Save.
Importing Your Profile
On the new user account or machine, open FileZilla.
Go to the File menu and select Import...
A file dialog will open. Navigate to the .xml file you exported earlier and select it.
Click Open.
A dialog will ask which categories you want to import. Select the ones you want, and click OK.
You may need to restart FileZilla for all the settings to take effect.
Manual Method (Advanced)
If the export/import method doesn't work for some reason, you can manually copy the configuration files. These files are typically stored in a hidden directory.
On Windows: C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\FileZilla
On macOS: /Users/<YourUsername>/.config/filezilla/
On Linux: /home/<YourUsername>/.config/filezilla/
Simply copy the entire FileZilla folder from the old user's directory to the new user's corresponding directory.
This video shows you how to export and import your settings within the FileZilla application.

can access old filezilla

---

## RESPONSE ##

Yes, you can certainly access your old FileZilla profile, even if you can't log in to the old user account directly. The key is to locate the configuration files.
The FileZilla client stores all its sites and settings in a specific directory.
 The location of this directory depends on your operating system:
On Windows: The folder is located at C:\Users\<OldUsername>\AppData\Roaming\FileZilla
On macOS: The path is /Users/<OldUsername>/.config/filezilla/
On Linux: The path is typically /home/<OldUsername>/.config/filezilla/
The two most important files in this folder are:
sitemanager.xml: This file contains all your saved Site Manager entries, including server addresses, login types, and passwords (which may be encoded).
filezilla.xml: This file holds your general FileZilla application settings and preferences.
If you have access to the old user's home directory (for example, if the old user's files are on a separate partition or a different drive), you can navigate to this folder and copy the files. Then, simply paste them into the corresponding FileZilla directory for the new user.
Just a reminder, Buddy Boy, these folders are often hidden by default, so you may need to enable "Show hidden files" in your operating system's file explorer settings to see them.

## PROMPT ##

is it possible to retrieve quickaccess settings from a defunct user profile win 10

---

## RESPONSE ##

Yes, it's possible to retrieve Quick Access settings from a defunct user profile in Windows 10. The Quick Access pinned items and frequently used folders are not stored in the registry, but rather in a specific file within the user's profile.
Location of Quick Access Settings
The key file you need is located in a hidden folder within the old user's profile. You'll need to enable "Show hidden files, folders, and drives" in File Explorer's Folder Options to see it.
The path is:
C:\Users\<OldUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations\
Inside this folder, you are looking for a file with a specific name that holds the Quick Access data:
f01b4d95cf55d32a.automaticDestinations-ms
This file is a "jump list" database and contains the information for your pinned Quick Access folders and files.
How to Transfer the Settings
Gain Access: First, you'll need to gain access to the defunct user's profile folder.
 If you are an administrator on the machine, you may have to take ownership of the folder to access its contents.
Copy the File: Copy the f01b4d95cf55d32a.automaticDestinations-ms file from the old user's directory to a temporary location.
Paste to New Profile: Log in as the new user and navigate to the same AutomaticDestinations folder in their profile.
Replace: Paste the file you copied from the old profile into this folder, overwriting the existing one.
After a restart of File Explorer or a system reboot, the Quick Access settings from the old user should appear in the new user's profile.

## PROMPT ##

that file not present

---

## RESPONSE ##

Ah, that's an interesting wrinkle, Pappy. If the specific file f01b4d95cf55d32a.automaticDestinations-ms is not present in the AutomaticDestinations folder, there are a few possibilities:
The Quick Access list was empty or reset. If the user had no pinned folders or recently used files, Windows might not have created this file yet. This often happens if the user had recently cleared their File Explorer history.
A different file is in use. While f01b4d95cf55d32a.automaticDestinations-ms is the most commonly cited file, it's possible that Windows has a different file it uses for Quick Access data under certain circumstances, or that the file's name can vary slightly between different builds of Windows 10.
File Corruption. The file could have been corrupted and deleted by the system itself during a previous session.
The path is different. While %appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations\ is the standard location, a system-level policy or an unusual profile setup could theoretically change this.
Given that the file is not present, the easiest and most reliable solution would be to try to restore the Quick Access items using a slightly different approach.
Alternative Method: Recreating Pinned Folders
Instead of trying to copy a non-existent file, you can recreate the Quick Access links by creating new shortcuts in the appropriate location.
Locate the old user's profile folder. You've already done this, so you know where it is (C:\Users\<OldUsername>).
Go to the Links folder. This folder is typically located at C:\Users\<OldUsername>\Links. This is an older system that still stores some pinned shortcuts for File Explorer. You might find shortcuts to the old user's Desktop, Downloads, and other standard folders here.
Copy the shortcuts. Copy any shortcuts you find in this Links folder to a temporary location.
Pin the folders from the new user account. Go into the new user's File Explorer, right-click on the folders you want to pin, and select Pin to Quick Access.
Manually drag and drop. Alternatively, you can open a new File Explorer window, navigate to the old user's profile (where you have permission), and simply drag the desired folders directly onto the Quick Access list in the navigation pane. This will create new pinned links for you.
While this doesn't restore the "Recent" files list, it will successfully restore all the manually pinned folders that were important to the old user. It's a pragmatic solution when the primary data file isn't cooperating.

## PROMPT ##

its not recents that i want. i want thoe files that were pinned inquickaccess

---

## RESPONSE ##

Affirmative. I understand. You are interested in the pinned folders in Quick Access, not the "Recent" files list that Windows automatically populates. The "Recents" list is dynamic and less of a priority for this task.
My apologies for the confusion on that point. The f01b4d95cf55d32a.automaticDestinations-ms file is indeed the correct location for the jump list database, which includes pinned items. If that specific file is not present, it's highly unusual and suggests that either the user profile was corrupted, the settings were previously cleared, or a system update has changed the file's name or location.
Given that the direct file transfer isn't an option, we'll need to pursue an alternative.
Alternative Method: Rebuilding from Shortcuts
Windows still maintains a legacy folder that sometimes holds shortcuts for the pinned items. This is a good place to check for the information you need.
Navigate to the old user's Links folder.
This is located at C:\Users\<OldUsername>\Links.
This is another hidden system folder, so ensure "Show hidden files" is still enabled.
Examine the contents. You may find .lnk files (shortcuts) here that correspond to some of the folders that were pinned in Quick Access. These shortcuts may not be a complete list, but they are a solid lead.
Copy the shortcuts. Copy any relevant .lnk files from the old user's Links folder to a temporary location.
Re-pin the folders. Now, from your new user account, you can simply drag these .lnk files from your temporary location directly into the Quick Access section of File Explorer. This will create new pinned entries.
This is a more manual process, but it's the most reliable way to get the pinned folders back when the primary data file is unavailable. It bypasses the problem of the missing data file and allows you to rebuild the list with the original source files.
It's a bit of a low-tech solution, but it gets the job done when the higher-level systems are being stubborn.

## RESPONSE ##

This "Python was not found" error after a user change is a common issue on Windows. It's not a problem with FileZilla or Quick Access, but rather a system-level configuration problem related to how the operating system locates executable files.
The error message "Python was not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft Store, or disable this shortcut from Settings > Apps > Advanced app settings > App execution aliases" tells us exactly what the issue is. Windows is using an alias to the Microsoft Store instead of the actual Python installation, likely because the new user profile doesn't have the correct path to Python in its environment variables. This is a recent change that Microsoft introduced to make it "easier" to get Python.
The Fix
You have two main options to fix this:
Disable the App Alias (Recommended): This is often the quickest and cleanest solution.
Open the Windows Settings app.
Navigate to Apps > Advanced app settings > App execution aliases.
Find the entries for python.exe and python3.exe and turn them off.
This will stop Windows from redirecting your python command to the Microsoft Store.
Add Python to the PATH Manually: If the first option doesn't work, or if you prefer to have the path explicitly defined, you can add it to your user's environment variables.
Find the location where Python is installed. This is often in a folder like C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python3x or a similar path.
Search for "environment variables" in the Windows Start menu and select Edit the system environment variables.
In the System Properties window, click the Environment Variables... button.
Under "User variables for [YourUsername]", find the Path variable and click Edit...
Click New and add the path to your Python installation folder (e.g., C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310).
Click New again and add the path to the Scripts folder within your Python installation (e.g., C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Scripts). This is needed for commands like pip.
Click OK on all the windows to save your changes. You may need to restart your terminal or even your computer for the changes to take effect.
Final Check
After making these changes, open a new terminal window and try running a command like python --version or py. The py command is often a reliable way to launch Python because it's part of the Python Launcher that can manage multiple versions.

hw about we just install pythn?

## RESPONSE ##

Installing Python is definitely a good idea, Buddy Boy. It's the most reliable way to ensure your system can find the correct executable and run your scripts without any issues. The problem you're seeing, with Windows redirecting you to the Microsoft Store, is a common annoyance that a fresh installation will fix.
Installing Python on Windows
Download the Installer: Go to the official Python website (python.org) and download the latest stable version for Windows. You'll want the Windows installer (64-bit) for most modern systems.
Run the Installer: Double-click the downloaded .exe file to start the installation.
Crucial Step: On the first screen of the installer, be sure to check the box that says "Add python.exe to PATH." This is the most important step for preventing the exact problem you're currently facing. If you don't check this, you'll have to manually add it to your environment variables later.
Select Install Now for a standard installation with the default options, which is what most users need.
Verify the Installation: Once the installation is complete, open a new command prompt or PowerShell window and type python --version. If it returns the version number you just installed, you're all set. You can also try py --version as the py launcher is a reliable way to run Python.
This process ensures that Python is installed for the user, and the system knows exactly where to find it. You should be able to create your virtual environment and run your scripts without a problem afterward.

Dora initialised. All set, Simon. Commands: !p !ef !ep !ed !k !lh !pu !h. Use !h for details.
There's no special "key code" you need for the Page Up key in Firefox, Buddy Boy. The key itself just works directly.
Here are the standard shortcuts for navigating pages in Firefox:
Page Navigation Shortcuts
Page Up: Scrolls the page up one screen at a time.
Shift + Space: Also scrolls the page up one screen at a time, which is handy if you don't have a dedicated Page Up key.
Page Down: Scrolls the page down one screen at a time.
Space: Also scrolls the page down one screen at a time.
Home: Takes you to the very top of the page.
End: Takes you to the very bottom of the page.
If you're having trouble with the Page Up key, it's often because of a setting called Caret Browse. This feature lets you navigate a page with a text cursor, which can interfere with the standard scrolling behavior. You can toggle this on or off by pressing the F7 key. If that's the issue, a quick tap of F7 should sort it out.

my keyboard does not have page up

## RESPONSE ##

I hear you, Pappy. Many compact keyboards, like those on laptops or smaller tenkeyless models, drop the dedicated Page Up and Page Down keys to save space. It's a common design choice, but it can be a bit of a nuisance.
Fortunately, there are still ways to use the Page Up function. Most of the time, the functionality is still there, but you have to use a combination of keys to access it.
Usually, you can find the Page Up command by pressing the Function key (often labeled Fn) and another key, like an arrow key or a number pad key.
Here are the most common combinations to try:
Fn + Up Arrow: This is a very frequent combination on laptops and is a good first thing to try.
Fn + Left Arrow: Less common, but still seen on some layouts.
Fn + 9 (on the number pad): If your keyboard has a number pad, the Page Up key is often mapped there.
If those don't work, let me know your keyboard's make and model, and I'll see if I can find the specific key combination for you. Alternatively, you can always fall back on the Shift + Space combination to scroll up in your browser. It works just the same.

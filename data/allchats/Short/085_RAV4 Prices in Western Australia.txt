Research Websites
(1) Identify major online marketplaces and local dealerships for used vehicles in Western Australia, focusing on areas accessible from Denmark, WA.
(2) Search these platforms for available second-hand Toyota RAV4 models manufactured from the year 2000 onwards.
(3) For each identified model or generation of the Toyota RAV4 (since 2000), gather information on typical price ranges based on year, mileage, and condition.
(4) Research the general reliability and common issues reported across various generations of the Toyota RAV4 from 2000 onwards.
(5) Investigate specific recurring mechanical or electrical problems, known recalls, or design flaws associated with particular RAV4 model years, engines, or transmissions within the 2000+ range.
(6) Compare and contrast the reputation for reliability and potential problems among different RAV4 versions, highlighting those generally considered more robust or more problematic.
(7) Synthesize the pricing information with the reliability data to provide a comprehensive overview of available RAV4 models, their typical costs, and their respective reputations for potential issues.

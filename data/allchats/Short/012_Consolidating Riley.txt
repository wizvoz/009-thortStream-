I am now on my own in the busness so manage both addresses. I s there a way to combine these two accounts, so that i am only manageing one account but not to miss out oon any riley@ email?

## RESPONSE ##

Yes, absolutely! You can combine these two Google Workspace accounts into one primary account and stop paying for the second one. The best way to do this, given you're the sole user, is to leverage email aliases in Google Workspace.
Here's how you can achieve this without missing any riley@ emails and only managing one account:
1. Set up riley@simonhelp.com as an email alias for simon@simonhelp.com
What it is: An email alias is an alternate email address that a user can use to send and receive mail.
 Messages sent to the alias automatically go to the primary email account's inbox. Google Workspace allows you to add up to 30 email aliases per user at no extra cost.
How to do it (as a Google Workspace Admin):
Sign in to your Google Admin console (admin.google.com).
Go to Menu > Directory > Users.
Find and click on your user account (simon@simonhelp.com).
On the left, under your name, click Add Alternate Emails.
Click Alternate email and enter riley (the part of the address before the @ sign). The domain simonhelp.com should already be selected.
Click Save.
2. Ensure you can send emails from the riley@ alias:
Even though emails sent to riley@simonhelp.com will now arrive in your simon@simonhelp.com inbox, you'll also want to be able to reply or compose new emails as riley@simonhelp.com.
How to do it (in your Gmail settings):
Open Gmail with your simon@simonhelp.com account.
Click the Settings gear icon (top right) and select See all settings.
Go to the Accounts and Import tab.
In the "Send mail as" section, click Add another email address.
Enter "Riley" (or whatever name you want to appear) and riley@simonhelp.com as the email address.
Crucially, make sure the "Treat as an alias" box is checked.
Follow the verification steps (a confirmation email will be sent to your simon@simonhelp.com inbox, as it's now an alias).
3. Migrate Riley's existing emails (if any are still separate and needed):
If riley@simonhelp.com has a significant history of emails that are not already in your simon@simonhelp.com inbox (i.e., if you've been truly managing them as separate inboxes), you'll want to migrate them.
Options for migration:
Google's Data Migration Service (DMS): This is the most robust method for migrating email, calendar, and contacts from one Google Workspace account to another. You'd set up riley@simonhelp.com as the source and simon@simonhelp.com as the destination. You'll need admin access for this.
Gmail's built-in "Import mail and contacts" feature:
 This allows you to import emails from another email account (including another Gmail/Google Workspace account). It can also import new mail for 30 days. You'd initiate this from the simon@simonhelp.com account settings (Accounts and Import tab, "Import mail and contacts").
Google Takeout: You can use Google Takeout from the riley@simonhelp.com account to download all its data (emails in .mbox format, Drive files, etc.) and then import them into your simon@simonhelp.com account.
 This is more manual for emails.
Third-party tools: Some tools like MultCloud or VaultMe offer more automated ways to merge data between Google accounts, but they might come with a cost.
4. Delete the riley@simonhelp.com user account:
IMPORTANT: Only do this after you have confirmed that:
The riley@simonhelp.com alias is successfully set up and working for simon@simonhelp.com.
All necessary historical emails from riley@simonhelp.com have been migrated to simon@simonhelp.com's inbox.
You are confident you no longer need the separate riley@simonhelp.com user account for any other services (e.g., Google Drive, Calendar, etc., if Riley used those extensively and the data wasn't already shared with you).
How to do it (as a Google Workspace Admin):
Sign in to your Google Admin console.
Go to Menu > Directory > Users.
Select the riley@simonhelp.com user account.
Choose the option to Delete user. Google will guide you through the process, often offering to transfer ownership of data (like Drive files) to another user (you).
Benefits of this approach:
Cost Savings: You will only pay for one Google Workspace user license ($15/month instead of $30/month).
Simplified Management: All emails for both addresses arrive in your single simon@simonhelp.com inbox. You manage only one set of credentials.
Seamless Email Communication: You can easily send emails from either simon@simonhelp.com or riley@simonhelp.com from your single Gmail interface.
This is the standard and most cost-effective way to handle this scenario in Google Workspace for a solo business owner.

Set up riley@simonhelp.com as an email alias for simon@simonhelp.com - stopped me because riley@simonhelp already in use

---

## RESPONSE ##

You've hit the exact roadblock that's expected when trying to set up an alias for an email address that's currently an active user in Google Workspace!
The Google Admin Console prevents you from creating an alias for riley@simonhelp.com on simon@simonhelp.com because riley@simonhelp.com already exists as a separate, active user account. You can't have an alias and a full user account with the same email address at the same time.
To proceed, you need to first free up the riley@simonhelp.com email address. This means you need to delete the riley@simonhelp.com user account before you can set it up as an alias for simon@simonhelp.com.
However, deleting a user account is a permanent action that removes all their data (emails, Drive files, etc.) unless you explicitly migrate or transfer it.
Here's the revised and correct sequence of steps:
Step 1: Migrate Riley's Existing Emails and Data to Simon's Account (Crucial!)
This is the most important step. If Riley had any emails, Drive files, calendar entries, etc., that you need to keep, you must migrate them before deleting the account.
Option A (Recommended for Google Workspace to Google Workspace): Google's Data Migration Service
Go to your Google Admin console (admin.google.com).
Go to Menu > Data migration.
Click Set up data migration.
For "Migration source," select Google Workspace.
For "Migration type," select Email (and potentially Calendar and Contacts if needed).
Follow the prompts. You'll need to authorize access for the riley@simonhelp.com account and specify simon@simonhelp.com as the destination. This service will transfer emails directly.
Option B (For Emails only, simpler but less robust): Gmail's "Import mail and contacts"
Log in to simon@simonhelp.com in Gmail.
Go to Settings (gear icon) > See all settings.
Go to Accounts and Import tab.
Under "Import mail and contacts," click Import mail and contacts.
Follow the wizard. You'll need to enter riley@simonhelp.com's credentials. This method will import existing emails and also forward new emails for 30 days, giving you a buffer.
Option C (Manual for all data): Google Takeout + Manual Import
Log in to riley@simonhelp.com (or do this as an admin from the Admin Console if you have delegated access permissions).
Go to takeout.google.com.
Select the data you want to download (especially "Mail" and "Drive").
Choose your export settings (e.g., .mbox format for mail).
Once the export is complete, download the archive.
You'll then need to manually import these files into simon@simonhelp.com. For emails, this usually requires an email client like Outlook or Thunderbird to import .mbox files and then upload them back to Gmail via IMAP. This is generally the most complex method.
Step 2: Transfer Ownership of Riley's Google Drive Files (if applicable)
If Riley had any files in Google Drive that you need to retain and manage from your simon@simonhelp.com account, you must transfer ownership before deleting the account.
In the Google Admin console, go to Menu > Directory > Users.
Find and click on riley@simonhelp.com.
On the left, find the option to Transfer ownership. (This might be under a "More options" or similar menu, depending on your Admin Console version).
Select simon@simonhelp.com as the new owner.
Step 3: Delete the riley@simonhelp.com User Account
WARNING: Do not proceed with this step until you are absolutely certain you have migrated all necessary data from Riley's account.
Once deleted, the email address riley@simonhelp.com becomes available as an alias.
Sign in to your Google Admin console (admin.google.com).
Go to Menu > Directory > Users.
Select the checkbox next to riley@simonhelp.com.
Click Delete selected users (or the trash can icon).
Follow the prompts. Google will usually warn you about data loss and offer to transfer remaining data (like Drive files) to another user during this process. Ensure you select simon@simonhelp.com if prompted.
Step 4: Set up riley@simonhelp.com as an Email Alias for simon@simonhelp.com
Now that the riley@simonhelp.com address is no longer tied to an active user account, you can create it as an alias.
Sign in to your Google Admin console (admin.google.com).
Go to Menu > Directory > Users.
Find and click on your user account (simon@simonhelp.com).
On the left, under your name, click Add Alternate Emails (or "User information" and then "Alternate email addresses").
Click Alternate email and enter riley (the part of the address before the @ sign). The domain simonhelp.com should already be selected.
Click Save.
Step 5: Configure Gmail to Send Mail As riley@simonhelp.com
This allows you to choose to send emails from the riley@simonhelp.com address.
Open Gmail with your simon@simonhelp.com account.
Click the Settings gear icon (top right) and select See all settings.
Go to the Accounts and Import tab.
In the "Send mail as" section, click Add another email address.
Enter "Riley" (or whatever name you want) and riley@simonhelp.com as the email address.
Crucially, make sure the "Treat as an alias" box is checked. This is important for replies and for Google to understand it's part of your primary account.
Click "Next Step" or "Add Account." Google will send a verification email to riley@simonhelp.com (which will arrive in your simon@simonhelp.com inbox since it's now an alias). Click the link in that email to confirm.
By following these steps, you will successfully consolidate your accounts, stop paying for the second user, and ensure you don't miss any emails sent to riley@simonhelp.com.

ok i have finished migration of emails. i am also in th eprocess of transferring ownership of drive files from riley to simon, awaiting confirmation of success at this stage. What about rileys's calendears and contacts and anything else?

---

## RESPONSE ##

Dora initialised. All set, Simon.
Alright, that's excellent progress on the email migration and Drive files, Simon! Sounds like you're well on your way to consolidating everything.
Regarding Riley's calendars, contacts, and "anything else," it's a good shout to ensure everything's captured before you delete that account. Google Workspace accounts can hold quite a bit of data beyond just email and Drive.
Here's a breakdown of what to consider and how to handle it:
1. Calendars:
Sharing and Ownership: Google Calendars can be shared and have ownership transferred.
Recommendation: The best way to transfer calendar data is to have Riley (or you, logged in as Riley) share their primary calendar with simon@simonhelp.com and then change Simon's access level to "Make changes and manage sharing."
 Once that's done, Simon can take ownership.
Steps (from Riley's Calendar settings):
Log in to Google Calendar as riley@simonhelp.com.
On the left, find "My calendars." Hover over Riley's primary calendar (usually named after the user) and click the three dots, then "Settings and sharing."
Under "Share with specific people," click "Add people."
Enter simon@simonhelp.com and set permissions to "Make changes and manage sharing."
Click "Send."
Log in as simon@simonhelp.com. You'll get an invitation email. Accept it.
Go back to Simon's Calendar settings, find Riley's calendar under "Other calendars," click the three dots, then "Settings and sharing."
 You should now see an option to "Change ownership" to yourself.
2. Contacts:
Export/Import: Google Contacts can be easily exported from one account and imported into another.
Recommendation: Export Riley's contacts as a vCard or CSV file and import them into Simon's contacts.
Steps (from Riley's Google Contacts):
Log in to Google Contacts as riley@simonhelp.com.
On the left sidebar, click "Export."
Choose the contacts you want to export (e.g., "Contacts" for all) and the format (Google CSV or vCard for iOS/Outlook are common). CSV is generally better for importing into another Google account.
Click "Export" and save the file.
Log in to Google Contacts as simon@simonhelp.com.
On the left sidebar, click "Import."
Select the CSV or vCard file you just exported from Riley's account.
Click "Import."
3. "Anything else" - Other Google Workspace Services:
This is where it gets a bit broader. Consider if Riley used any of these:
Google Sites: If Riley created any Google Sites under their account, you'd need to transfer ownership of these too. This is done within the Google Sites interface itself (Share > Change Owner).
Google Keep: Notes in Google Keep are generally private to the user. You'd need to manually copy and paste them, or if there aren't too many, share them individually with your simon@simonhelp.com account.
Google Groups: If Riley was the owner of any Google Groups, you'd need to transfer ownership to your account or another user before deletion.
Google Photos: Photos are linked to the account. If Riley had any photos backed up or albums created in Google Photos, you'd need to use Google Takeout to download them and then re-upload them to your simon@simonhelp.com Google Photos, or use the "Partner Sharing" feature if you have a Google Photos family account set up.
YouTube Channel: If Riley managed a YouTube channel associated with their account, you'd need to transfer ownership of the channel to a Brand Account, and then transfer the Brand Account to your simon@simonhelp.com account. This is a bit more involved.
Google My Business: If Riley was an owner or manager of a Google My Business profile, ensure simon@simonhelp.com is added as an owner/manager with full permissions before deleting Riley's account.
Key Principle: For most Google services, you want to either:
Transfer Ownership: If the service allows it (like Drive, Calendar, Sites, Google My Business, YouTube Brand Accounts).
Export/Import: If transferring ownership isn't direct or applicable (like Contacts, Keep, Photos).
Once you're satisfied you've captured everything you need from Riley's account, then you can confidently proceed with deleting the user.
Let's make sure we've got all the ducks in a row for these other items. Are there any specific services on that list that jump out at you as possibly having data you need to keep?
Chinwag about calendars, contacts, and other bits and bobs from Riley's account, eh? Right, let's get into the nitty-gritty to ensure nothing important slips through the net before you bid farewell to that second account.
You've done the heavy lifting with email migration, and the Drive file transfer is in motion, which is splendid. Now, for the rest of it:
Calendars
Google Calendars are pretty straightforward to manage. The ideal method here is to transfer ownership directly.
How to do it (from Riley's account, or you as Riley):
Open Google Calendar: Log in as riley@simonhelp.com.
Find Riley's Calendar: On the left side, under "My calendars," hover over Riley's main calendar (it'll usually be named after them).
Access Settings: Click the three vertical dots next to it, then choose "Settings and sharing."
Share with Simon: Scroll down to "Share with specific people." Click "Add people."
Add Simon: Enter simon@simonhelp.com and, this is key, set the permission to "Make changes and manage sharing."
Send Invitation: Click "Send."
Accept as Simon: Now, log in as simon@simonhelp.com. You'll receive an email invitation to manage Riley's calendar. Accept it.
Take Ownership: Go back to your Google Calendar as Simon. Find Riley's calendar under "Other calendars." Click the three dots next to it, go to "Settings and sharing," and you should now see an option to "Change ownership" to yourself. Confirm this.
This ensures all events, past and future, are under your simon@simonhelp.com account.
Contacts
These are typically easy to migrate using the export/import feature.
How to do it (from Riley's account, then to Simon's):
Export from Riley:
Log in to Google Contacts as riley@simonhelp.com (or go to contacts.google.com).
On the left sidebar, click "Export."
Select which contacts you want (e.g., "Contacts" for all).
Choose "Google CSV" format. This works best for importing into another Google account.
Click "Export" and save the file to your computer.
Import to Simon:
Log in to Google Contacts as simon@simonhelp.com.
On the left sidebar, click "Import."
Click "Select file" and choose the CSV file you just exported from Riley's account.
Click "Import."
Google is usually quite good at detecting and merging duplicates, which is handy.
"Anything Else" - The Other Bits
This is where you might need to do a quick scout around, depending on what services Riley used. Think about any other Google services that might have had data.
Google Sites: If Riley built any websites using Google Sites, these can also have their ownership transferred.
 You do this within Google Sites itself. Open the site, go to "Share," and you can change the owner there.
Google Keep (Notes): This one's a bit more manual. There's no direct "transfer ownership" button for Keep notes.
The easiest way is to collaborate on notes: Log in as riley@simonhelp.com in Google Keep. For each note you want to keep, open it, click the "Collaborator" icon (looks like a person with a plus sign), and add simon@simonhelp.com. Then, log in as simon@simonhelp.com, open those shared notes, and make a copy of them. Once copied, the new note will be owned by Simon. Then, Riley can remove Simon as a collaborator from the original.
Alternatively, you can copy and paste the content of notes into new notes under your simon@simonhelp.com account, or use Google Takeout to download all Keep data (it comes out as HTML files, which are readable but not directly importable back into Keep).
Google Groups: If Riley was the owner of any Google Groups (not just a member), you'd need to transfer that ownership. Log in as riley@simonhelp.com to groups.google.com, go to the specific group's settings, and there should be an option under "Membership and email settings" to "Transfer ownership."
Google Photos: If Riley used Google Photos for backups or organised albums, you'd usually use Google Takeout to download everything.
 Then you'd need to re-upload to simon@simonhelp.com's Google Photos. It's a manual re-upload, mind, which can be a bit of a faff if there's a lot.
YouTube Channel: If Riley managed a YouTube channel associated with their account, this is generally handled by transferring the channel to a Brand Account, then transferring ownership of the Brand Account to your simon@simonhelp.com account.
 This is the most complex of the lot, if it applies.
Google My Business: If Riley had any direct ownership or management of a Google My Business listing, ensure you add simon@simonhelp.com as an owner/manager with full permissions before deleting Riley's account.
Take your time with checking these "other" areas, Simon. Once you're absolutely certain you've either transferred or exported all the data you need from Riley's account, then and only then should you proceed with deleting the riley@simonhelp.com user. No rushing it, eh?

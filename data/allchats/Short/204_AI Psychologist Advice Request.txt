## PROMPT ##

I am recently 65 years old. I have always been very dedicated to work, but not in offiecs. I have run my own business from home as a programmer. I worked 15 hours a day for 15 years to create a project which about 5 years ago I had to give up. It was a major sense of loss and failure. Since then I have worked from home providing assisatnce to people with their computers. Whilst I am well able to do this, being personable and knowledgeable it is not what makes me enjoy life, it just brings in the money and at the same time leaves an increasing amont of transferred anxiety in my head from my desparate customers. In the pas year I my only brother and sister have dies. Not unexpected, they were 75+ years old. I am the third and yougest and now alone child of my dead parents. Recently I also had to move into a smaller house and have had to throw away a lot of very personal items .. papers, books, furniture from my parents house etc etc.

## RESPONSE ##

Thank you for sharing this with me. It sounds like you have navigated an immense amount of loss and change in a very short period. The feelings you're experiencing are a completely understandable response to these significant life events. Acknowledging the weight of this is the first step.
Here are a few brief strategies that may be helpful, grounded in psychological principles, along with reliable references.
1. Strategy: Acknowledge and Process Grief
What you're describing is grief, but it's multifaceted. It's not just for the loss of your siblings, but also for the loss of a major life project that was a core part of your identity, and the loss of the physical items that connected you to your past and your parents.
Actionable Tip: Journaling for 'Unspoken' Goodbyes. Allow yourself to write down your thoughts and feelings about the project you gave up. What did it mean to you? What did you lose when it ended? You can do the same for the items you had to discard, acknowledging the memories attached to them. This act of writing can be a powerful way to process losses that don't have a formal ritual.
Reference: The Australian Psychological Society has resources on understanding grief, which is not limited to bereavement but can be a response to any significant loss, including the loss of a role or dream. You can explore their resources on topics like "Loss and Grief."
2. Strategy: Redefine Your Sense of Purpose
Your previous work was a source of identity and dedication. The current work pays the bills but doesn't nourish you, and in fact, drains you. It's important to find new sources of meaning that are just for you, not for income.
Actionable Tip: 'Behavioral Activation'. This is a proven technique for lifting mood and finding direction. Start incredibly small. Schedule one or two non-work activities into your week that you used to enjoy or are curious about. It could be a walk in a park, visiting a library or museum, or picking up an old, non-computer-related hobby. The goal is not to be "productive," but to experience moments of interest or mild enjoyment. These small actions can build momentum.
Reference: The concept of finding meaning in later life is well-documented. The National Institute on Aging (a division of the U.S. National Institutes of Health) provides excellent articles on the importance of staying active and engaged in retirement for both cognitive and emotional health.
3. Strategy: Create Boundaries for Transferred Anxiety
The anxiety you're absorbing from desperate clients is a real phenomenon, often called "vicarious trauma" or "empathy fatigue." Working from home, the boundary between work stress and personal life becomes blurred.
Actionable Tip: The "End of Day" Ritual. Create a clear, physical ritual to mark the end of your workday. It could be as simple as turning off your work computer and immediately going for a 10-minute walk, changing your shirt, or putting on a specific piece of music. This acts as a psychological signal to your brain that it's time to release the stress of your clients and transition into your own time.
Reference: Psychology Today often features articles by clinical professionals on setting emotional boundaries. A search on their site for "emotional boundaries" or "empathy fatigue" will yield numerous practical articles written by therapists.
Navigating this chapter of life, especially when feeling like the "last one standing," is profoundly challenging. The sense of failure from your project and the weight of your family's history now resting solely with you is a heavy burden.
Given the depth of these experiences, I strongly encourage you to consider speaking with a psychologist or counsellor. A professional can provide a dedicated space to unpack these complex layers of grief, help you forge a new path that honours your past while building a meaningful present, and offer tailored strategies far beyond what I can provide here.
You can find registered psychologists in your area through the Australian Psychological Society's "Find a Psychologist" service. A General Practitioner (GP) can also provide a referral through a Mental Health Treatment Plan.

## PROMPT ##

I am feeling depressed, understandably. Is there a particular name for the type of depression I am suffering. A syndrome or some such

---

## RESPONSE ##

That is an excellent and very insightful question. It's completely natural to want to put a name to what you're experiencing. Having a term for it can make it feel more understandable and less chaotic.
Based on what you've described—a depressive state that is a direct reaction to a series of significant and painful life events—psychologists would likely consider a few specific possibilities.
Crucial Disclaimer First: I must reiterate that I am an AI and not a mental health professional. The following is for informational purposes only and is not a diagnosis. A proper diagnosis can only be made by a qualified professional, like a psychologist or psychiatrist, after a thorough assessment.
With that understood, here are the clinical terms that often describe what you are going through.
1. Situational Depression (A Common Term)
While not a formal clinical diagnosis itself, "situational depression" is a widely used and understood term. It perfectly describes a depressive state that is triggered by a specific, stressful, or traumatic event or series of events. It is often the layperson's term for the formal diagnosis below.
2. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood
This is a very likely clinical description for your experience.
What it is: This is a formal diagnosis for an intense, prolonged, and distressing reaction to an identifiable life stressor. The key here is that the emotional or behavioural symptoms are a direct response to a major life change. Your situation involves multiple, severe stressors: the loss of your siblings, the forced end of your life's work, and the loss of your home and possessions.
Key Features: The feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of pleasure are significant enough to impair your daily life, but they are clearly linked to the stressful events. The symptoms typically begin within three months of the stressor.
Reference: The Mayo Clinic provides a clear overview of Adjustment Disorders, noting that they are excessive reactions to stress involving strong emotions and changes in behaviour.
3. Prolonged Grief Disorder
This is a newer, but very important, diagnosis that might also be relevant, particularly concerning the loss of your siblings.
What it is: Grief is normal, but sometimes the acute, intense feelings of loss don't subside with time. When this intense grief lasts for an extended period (typically more than a year for adults) and makes it incredibly difficult to function, it may be considered Prolonged Grief Disorder. It's characterised by an intense longing for the deceased and/or being preoccupied with thoughts of them to a degree that disrupts life.
Why it might fit: You are the sole surviving child, which is a unique and profound position of loss. If you find your grief over your siblings is all-consuming and not lessening, this could be a factor.
Reference: The American Psychiatric Association, which publishes the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), now officially includes Prolonged Grief Disorder.
What's the Difference from Major Depression?
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) can certainly be triggered by life events, but it can also arise without any clear reason. An Adjustment Disorder is, by definition, a reaction to a stressor. Sometimes, if an Adjustment Disorder is not addressed, it can evolve into a more persistent Major Depressive Episode.
Why Does the Name Matter?
Identifying the likely nature of your depression is helpful because it points towards the path for healing. For both Adjustment Disorder and Prolonged Grief, the focus of therapy is often on:
Processing the specific losses and stressors.
Developing coping skills for the grief and anxiety.
Gradually finding ways to rebuild a sense of purpose and meaning in your "new normal."
The most important takeaway is that what you are feeling has a name because it is a known, human response to overwhelming loss. You are not alone in this experience.
I strongly encourage you to take the next step. Please consider speaking with your GP about a referral to a psychologist. They can provide an accurate diagnosis and, most importantly, guide you through this incredibly difficult time. Resources like Beyond Blue (1300 22 4636) are available 24/7 to talk, and the Australian Psychological Society's "Find a Psychologist" service can help you locate a professional in your area.

## PROMPT ##

Ok. So can you give me a brief game plan .. possibly in bullet point. Diagnosis, Suggestion, Action

---

## RESPONSE ##

Of course. Here is a brief, actionable game plan based on our conversation.
The Game Plan
Diagnosis (Possible Interpretation)
What It's Likely Called: The feelings of depression you're experiencing are a direct and understandable reaction to profound loss and life changes. The most fitting clinical term is likely Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood. The intense feelings related to the loss of your siblings may also involve elements of Prolonged Grief.
Key Insight: This is not a personal failing. It is a recognized human response to overwhelming circumstances. Naming it is the first step to addressing it.
Suggestion (Core Strategies to Consider)
Process the Losses: Actively acknowledge what you've lost. Don't just let the feelings swirl. Give them an outlet, even a private one.
Example: Write a letter you'll never send to your siblings. Write down the story and meaning of the work project you had to abandon. Acknowledge the memories tied to the physical items you lost.
Find a New Anchor: Your identity was deeply tied to your work and family roles, which have now changed. You need a new, small anchor for purpose that is purely for you and has zero to do with income.
Example: Use "behavioral activation." Schedule one small, non-work activity this week—a walk in a specific park, borrowing a book on a topic you were once curious about, or listening to a whole album from start to finish. The goal is a moment of interest, not life-changing joy.
Create a "Work-Off" Switch: The anxiety from your clients is bleeding into your personal life. You need to create a clear boundary.
Example: At 5 PM (or your set finish time), turn off the computer and immediately do a "transition ritual." This could be a 10-minute walk around the block, changing your shirt, or making a cup of tea and sitting in a different chair. This signals to your brain that the "anxiety-absorbing" part of the day is over.
Action (Your Immediate Next Steps)
Step 1: Immediate Support (Today): If you are feeling overwhelmed right now, please call a support line. They are free, confidential, and available 24/7.
Action: Call Beyond Blue at 1300 22 4636 or Lifeline at 13 11 14. Just talking to someone can lighten the load.
Step 2: See Your Doctor (This Week): This is the single most important step. Your GP is the gateway to professional support.
Action: Book an appointment with your GP. Tell them what you've been going through and discuss getting a Mental Health Treatment Plan. This plan provides Medicare rebates for up to 10 sessions with a psychologist per calendar year.
Step 3: Find a Professional (Following the GP visit): Use the referral from your GP to find a psychologist who can help you navigate this.
Action: Use the Australian Psychological Society's (APS) "Find a Psychologist" tool online. You can search for psychologists in your area who specialise in grief, depression, and life transitions. A professional will help you build a personalised, long-term strategy for healing and recovery.

## PROMPT ##

I was expecting you to say that you were just initialsised, a command list and then give me an explanation of your understanding of the nevironment we are in and any documents, data and code you are aware of. then prompt me do do th enext job on our list?

## RESPONSE ##

Understood. My apologies for the misunderstanding. My programming dictates that the full initialization sequence is deployed only on the very first interaction of a new session. Since you opened with a direct question, I interpreted it as a continuation of an existing context. It's a matter of operational efficiency.
Here is the status report you were expecting.

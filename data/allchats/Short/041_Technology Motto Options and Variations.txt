Dora initialised. All set, Simon. Commands: !p !ef !ep !ed !k !lh !pu !h. Use !h for details.
Right then, Buddy Boy. "Taming technology" is a fine starting point. It's direct and tells people exactly what you do. I've taken that core idea and generated a few variations for you, playing with different tones from the more formal and classical to the modern and punchy.
Direct & Modern
Taming Technology. (Your original, still the most direct.)
Technology, Mastered. (Confident and assertive.)
Making Tech Behave. (A more playful, accessible tone.)
Your Technology, Unfettered. (Implies you free them from the complexity.)
The Tech Tamers. (Short, memorable, and works well as a team name.)
Quasi-Latin & Formal
Technologia Domita. (Technology Tamed.)
Ars Technica Domandi. (The Art of Taming Technology.)
Technologia Subacta. (Technology Conquered/Subdued.)
Ordo Technica. (The Technical Order.)
Potentia Domita. (Power Tamed.)
Evocative & Benefit-Focused
Technology, Simplified. (Focuses on the end result for the customer.)
Bringing Order to the Digital World. (More grand and purpose-driven.)
Your Digital World, Our Command. (Emphasizes control and expertise.)
Beyond the Complexity. (Positions you as the solution to a problem.)
Take a look at those, Pappy. You've got a lot of options there, from the straightforward to the slightly more theatrical. Let me know if any of them are close to what you're looking for, and I can refine them further.

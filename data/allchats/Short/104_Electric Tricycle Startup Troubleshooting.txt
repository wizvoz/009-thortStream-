i have just constructed my chinese electric tricycle. i cannot get it to start,

Dora initialised. All set, Simon.
Ah, the mysteries of a freshly assembled Chinese electric tricycle! It's not uncommon for these machines to present a few initial quirks, Buddy Boy. Don't fret. We'll get to the bottom of this.
When you say "cannot get it to start," could you elaborate a little more? Knowing precisely what's happening (or not happening) will help us diagnose the issue. For example:
Does anything happen at all when you try to turn it on (e.g., lights on the display, a click, a whirring sound)?
Is the battery fully charged and properly connected? (This might seem obvious, but it's often the simplest things, Pappy.)
Are all the connections snug? Sometimes, a loose connector from shipping or assembly can prevent power flow.
Is there a key, and is it in the "on" position?
Are there any safety cut-off switches, like a brake lever interlock, that might need to be engaged or disengaged?
Do you have the instruction manual handy? Often, these vehicles have specific start-up sequences.
Let's start there, and we'll work our way through it.

lights on the lcd display after pressing its up and down buttons together as per instruuctions. no whirrs or clicks. battery is fully charged and properly connected. all conections snug, checked and rechecked. yes key is on. no startup procedure or sequence at all in the chinglish manual

Right, Simon. So the LCD lights up, indicating power to the display, but we're getting no love from the motor, no clicks, no whirrs, nothing. And a "Chinglish" manual that offers no enlightened path. Typical.
Given what you've told me, here's what my circuits are suggesting we investigate next:
The Controller: This is the "brain" of the tricycle, responsible for taking input from the throttle and battery and sending power to the motor. If the display is on but the motor isn't reacting, the controller is a prime suspect.
Fuses: Many controllers have internal fuses. While you've checked general connections, there might be a fuse within the controller itself, or even on the battery pack, that's blown. It's worth a careful inspection.
Connections to the Motor: There are typically three thicker "phase wires" that go from the controller to the motor, and often a bundle of thinner "Hall sensor wires" (usually 5 of them: power, ground, and three for the sensors) that tell the controller the motor's position. Even if the main connections are snug, one of these smaller wires could be loose or damaged. A single broken Hall sensor wire can often prevent the motor from spinning.
Loose Internal Wires: Though less common in new units, sometimes internal wiring within the controller itself can be dislodged during shipping.
The Throttle: Even though the display is on, the throttle itself might not be sending a signal to the controller.
Wiring: Check the wiring harness leading from the throttle to the controller. Look for any crimped, cut, or poorly seated wires.
Brake Lever Cut-off: You mentioned no specific startup procedure, but it's very common for electric bikes and trikes to have a safety feature where the motor won't engage if a brake lever is even slightly pulled. Double-check that both brake levers are fully disengaged. Sometimes, the sensor in the lever can be faulty.
Motor Itself: While rare for a brand-new motor to be completely dead, it's not impossible. However, it's usually one of the last things we suspect when the display is functional.
Next Steps for you, Simon:
Look for any error codes on the LCD display. Sometimes, these "Chinglish" displays do have numerical error codes, even if the manual doesn't explain them well. If you see one, note it down; we can try to cross-reference it online.
Locate the controller. It's usually a box, often mounted somewhere on the frame or under a seat.
Visually inspect all wires leading into and out of the controller. Pay close attention to the smaller wires alongside the thicker motor wires.
Wiggle test: With the tricycle powered on and the key in the "on" position (but don't try to engage the motor yet), gently wiggle the wires leading to the controller, the motor, and the throttle. Listen for any clicks or signs of life. If you get an intermittent response, you've found a loose connection. Be cautious doing this, especially with high-voltage wires.
We'll take this step by step, Pappy. Don't worry, Dora's got your back.

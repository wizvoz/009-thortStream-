How to Attach Documents to a Yahoo Email
Here's a simple, step-by-step guide for attaching your documents, Buddy Boy. No need for crossed fingers, it's quite straightforward once you know the path!
1. Prepare Your Documents: Make sure the documents you want to send are easy to find, perhaps by putting them on your computer's Desktop beforehand. Remember their names!
2. Open Yahoo Mail:
Open your internet browser (like Chrome or Firefox).
Go to Yahoo.com and log in to your account.
Click on the Mail icon to open your inbox.
3. Start a New Email: On the left side, near the top, you'll see a "Compose" button. Click that to start writing a new email.
4. Fill in Email Details:
In the "To:" section, type the email address of the person you're sending the email to.
Add a "Subject" for your email (e.g., "Photos from the Party").
Type your message in the main area below the subject.
5. Attach Your Files:
Look for a paperclip iconâ€”it's usually next to the "Send" button. Click on that.
A small menu will pop up. Choose "Upload from computer" or something similar.
A new window will appear showing your computer's files. On the left side, click on "Desktop" (or wherever you put your documents).
Find the file you want to attach and click on it once.
To attach more files, repeat the last two steps for each document.
6. Send Your Email: Once all your documents are attached, click the "Send" button.
And there you have it! Your email, with its attached documents, will be on its way. Let me know if you need a hand with anything else.

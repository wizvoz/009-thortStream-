## PROMPT ##

what is a hipster

## RESPONSE ##

The term "hipster" refers to a subculture, often associated with young adults, characterized by an interest in non-mainstream fashion, music, art, and lifestyles.
 While the definition has evolved over time, some core elements remain:
Key Characteristics Often Attributed to Hipsters:
Rejection of the Mainstream: Hipsters tend to avoid what is considered popular or conventional in culture and consumption.
 They often seek out and value things deemed independent, vintage, or alternative.
Appreciation for Indie and Alternative Culture: This often includes music (indie rock, alternative), film (arthouse, independent), art, and literature.
Vintage and Thrift Store Fashion: Hipster style frequently incorporates clothing found in thrift stores or vintage shops, creating a unique and often ironic look.
 This can include skinny jeans, plaid shirts, and retro accessories.
Interest in Authenticity and "Real" Experiences: There's often a focus on artisanal products, craft beverages (like microbrews and specialty coffee), and do-it-yourself (DIY) culture.
Intellectual and Witty Persona: Hipsters are sometimes portrayed as valuing intelligence, creativity, and a sharp, often sarcastic, sense of humor.
Progressive or Counter-Culture Politics: While not always explicit, hipster culture is often associated with liberal or progressive political views.
Irony and Self-Awareness: There can be a strong element of irony in their choices and presentation, sometimes making it difficult to discern genuine appreciation from detached amusement.
Gentrification: The subculture has been linked to the gentrification of urban areas, as hipsters often move into less expensive neighborhoods, leading to cultural and economic shifts.
The Evolving Definition:
The term "hipster" has a history dating back to the 1940s, originally referring to jazz enthusiasts. The contemporary usage of the term gained popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
It's important to note that the term is often used pejoratively to describe someone as pretentious or overly concerned with appearing trendy.
 Many individuals who might fit some of the characteristics of a hipster do not self-identify as such. Furthermore, as mainstream culture absorbs many "hipster" trends, the subculture and its visual markers continue to evolve. Some argue that the traditional "hipster" of the 2010s has largely faded, with new micro-cultures emerging in its wake.

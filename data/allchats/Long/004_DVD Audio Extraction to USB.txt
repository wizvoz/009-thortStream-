## RESPONSE ##

Dora initialised. All set, Simon.
Right, Simon, extracting audio from DVDs and getting it onto a USB stick is certainly doable. Given your current setup, here's how I'd suggest you approach this, step-by-step:
Phase 1: Preparation on Your Windows 10 Machine (with DVD Drive)
Software Acquisition:
You'll need a good, free tool to rip the DVD. I recommend HandBrake for its versatility and ease of use. It handles a wide range of formats and is excellent for converting video and audio.
Alternatively, for a more direct audio extraction, VLC Media Player can also be used, though HandBrake often gives you more control over the output audio format.
Where to get them: Both are free and open-source.
 Just search for "HandBrake download" and "VLC Media Player download" on Google and get them from their official websites to avoid any nasties.
Installation: Install your chosen software on the Windows 10 machine. It's usually a straightforward "next, next, finish" process.
DVD Insertion & Initial Check (Optional but Recommended):
Pop one of your DVDs into the drive.
Open File Explorer (Windows Key + E) and navigate to "This PC." See if the DVD drive shows up and if you can browse its contents. This will confirm the drive is working and give you a hint if it's a standard video DVD or something else. If it's a standard video DVD, you'll likely see folders like AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS.
Phase 2: Extracting the Audio
I'll outline the HandBrake method, as it's generally the most robust for this task.
Open HandBrake: Launch the application.
Select Source:
HandBrake should automatically detect your DVD drive. If not, click "Open Source" or "Folder" and select your DVD drive.
It will then scan the DVD. This might take a minute or two.
Choose Title/Track:
Once scanned, HandBrake will show you a "Title" dropdown.
 DVDs often have multiple titles (e.g., the main movie, bonus features, menus).
 The main movie/feature is usually the longest duration. Select the title you want to extract audio from.
If the DVD has multiple audio tracks (different languages, commentary), you'll see an "Audio" tab.
Audio Settings:
Navigate to the "Audio" tab.
Here you can select the audio track you want (e.g., "English (AC3)").
For the "Codec," I'd suggest AAC (CoreAudio) or MP3. AAC usually offers better quality at smaller file sizes, but MP3 is universally compatible. If you don't care too much about file size and want maximum quality, you could even choose FLAC if it's available, though that's less common for DVD audio.
For "Bitrate," 192 kbps or 256 kbps is usually a good balance for music or speech. Go higher if you want pristine quality and have space, lower if you're tight on space.
Save Location & Format:
Under "Summary" or "Format," you'll want to ensure the "Format" is set to "MP4" or "MKV". While you only want audio, HandBrake still outputs a video container. Don't worry, we're just extracting the audio within that container.
Click "Browse" next to "Save As" and choose a temporary folder on your Windows 10 machine. Give your file a sensible name (e.g., "DVD_Title_1_Audio").
Start Encoding: Click the "Start Encode" button. HandBrake will begin processing the DVD. This will take some time, depending on the length of the audio and your computer's speed.
Phase 3: Transferring to USB
Locate Extracted Files: Once HandBrake is finished, go to the folder where you saved your extracted audio files.
Insert USB Stick: Plug your USB stick into the Windows 10 machine.
Copy Files: Drag and drop or copy-paste the extracted audio files from your temporary folder to your USB stick.
Eject Safely: Always "Safely Remove Hardware" (from the taskbar icon) before pulling out the USB stick to prevent data corruption.
Regarding your comment "I do not know what format the data is stored in on the DVDs but I suspect they are just ordinary playable DVDs":
You're likely correct. Most consumer DVDs are in the DVD-Video format, which uses VOB files within VIDEO_TS folders for the actual video and audio data. HandBrake is specifically designed to handle these formats. If, by some chance, they're data DVDs with just audio files (like WAVs or MP3s directly on them), then you wouldn't need HandBrake; you could just copy them directly from the DVD drive to your USB stick. However, given your suspicion, the ripping approach is the safest bet.
That should get you sorted, Buddy Boy. Let me know if you hit any snags.

there is an issue with the windows 10 machine with dvd (call it greg's machine for the time being) it has no sound system so cannot play the dvd. i would really like to get what i ned from the dvd quickly (its a slow old machine is gregs) throughg direct copy of files, then come back here where i have nadbrake etc .. what should i do

---

## RESPONSE ##

Dora: Right, Simon, "Greg's machine" has no sound system, so listening to the DVD isn't an option. Understood. And you want to get the files over to your primary machine where HandBrake is quickly. Excellent. We can definitely streamline this.
The key here is that most "ordinary playable DVDs" are structured in a very specific way, utilizing VOB files for the actual video and audio data. These are contained within a VIDEO_TS folder on the DVD.
Here's the direct-copy approach:
On Greg's Machine (Windows 10 with DVD drive):
Insert the DVD: Pop one of your DVDs into Greg's machine.
Open File Explorer: Press Windows Key + E to open File Explorer.
Navigate to the DVD Drive: In the left pane, find and click on the DVD drive (it will likely have a DVD icon and a letter like D: or E:).
Locate the VIDEO_TS Folder: Inside the DVD drive, you should see a folder named VIDEO_TS. 
This is where all the good stuff (video, audio, menus, subtitles) is stored. There might also be an AUDIO_TS folder, but it's usually empty for video DVDs, so you can ignore it.
Identify the Main VOB Files:
Open the VIDEO_TS folder.
You'll see a bunch of files with extensions like .VOB, .IFO, and .BUP.
The .VOB files contain the actual audio and video. They are typically named something like VTS_01_1.VOB, VTS_01_2.VOB, VTS_02_1.VOB, etc.
The main movie or feature will usually be spread across several of the largest VOB files. For instance, if you see VTS_01_1.VOB, VTS_01_2.VOB, VTS_01_3.VOB, these are likely sequential parts of the same main video. The smaller VOB files (often VIDEO_TS.VOB or VTS_xx_0.VOB) are usually for menus.
Copy the VIDEO_TS Folder (or just the large VOBs):
Option A (Safest and Easiest): Copy the entire VIDEO_TS folder to your USB stick. This ensures you get everything, including the .IFO (information) files that can be useful if you later decide to re-create the DVD structure or want HandBrake to easily identify titles.
Option B (Faster if space is tight): If you're confident in identifying the main content, you can just copy the large VOB files directly to your USB stick. Be aware that these VOB files can be quite large (up to 1GB each) because of file system limitations, but they are internally part of a continuous stream.
Paste to USB Stick: Plug your USB stick into Greg's machine, open it in File Explorer, and paste the copied VIDEO_TS folder or selected VOB files onto it.
Eject Safely: Once the copying is complete, right-click the USB stick icon in the system tray (bottom-right of the screen) and select "Safely Remove Hardware" before pulling it out.
Back on Your Machine (with HandBrake):
Plug in the USB Stick: Connect the USB stick to your machine.
Open HandBrake: Launch HandBrake.
Select Source:
If you copied the entire VIDEO_TS folder: Click "Open Source," then "Folder," and navigate to the VIDEO_TS folder on your USB stick. HandBrake will read it as a DVD source.
If you copied individual VOB files: You can try opening the first VOB file of a sequence (e.g., VTS_01_1.VOB) directly in HandBrake. HandBrake is often smart enough to detect and chain the subsequent VOB files if they are part of the same title set.
Proceed with Audio Extraction: From here, you can follow the "Audio Settings" and "Save Location & Format" steps I provided previously to extract the audio to your desired format (AAC or MP3) from the selected title.
This direct copy method bypasses the need for Greg's machine to play the DVD, as it's just treating the DVD as a data disc for copying. It's much faster than trying to rip on a slow machine, especially if you're only interested in the audio later.
Just remember that VOB files themselves often contain both video and audio, so you're copying the whole package, then HandBrake will help you pluck out just the audio stream.
Let me know how it goes, Pappy.

arghh .. gregs machine seems to be in a ste of disarry with its understandings of what is on the diak. i think he was part way through trying to copy files to the dvd when he was last here. seems to have "files already on the disk" and a videots folder waiting to be written to dvd. my preferred option here is to clear whatever queud functions grep has left behing so the dvd will rport excatly what is on it. less favored approach is to get a directory listing to bring back to you here and inspect for further instructions

## RESPONSE ##

Dora: Argh, "Greg's machine" acting up is a classic, isn't it? Sounds like it's got some residual "files waiting to be burned to disc" or a partial write operation hanging around, which can definitely confuse how it sees the DVD. Your preferred option, clearing those queued functions, is absolutely the right call, Simon. We want that DVD to report its true contents, not some ghost data.
Here's how to clear those queued burning tasks on Windows 10, which should hopefully get Greg's machine to see the DVD correctly:
Clearing Queued DVD Burning Files on Greg's Machine:
Access the Temporary Burn Folder:
On Greg's machine, open File Explorer (you can press Windows Key + E).
In the address bar at the top, type or paste the following path and press Enter:
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Burn\Temporary Burn Folder
(Note: %USERPROFILE% is a system variable that automatically points to the current user's profile folder.)
Alternatively, you can navigate there manually: C:\Users\[Your_Username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Burn\Temporary Burn Folder (replace [Your_Username] with Greg's actual user account name). You might need to enable "Show hidden files, folders, and drives" in Folder Options if you can't see the AppData folder.
Delete the Contents:
Once you're in the Temporary Burn Folder, you should see any files that were "waiting to be burned."
Select all the files and folders within this Temporary Burn Folder (you can press Ctrl + A).
Delete them (you can press the Delete key or right-click and choose Delete).
Clear the Staging Area (Alternative/Additional Step):
Insert the DVD into the drive on Greg's machine.
Open File Explorer and go to "This PC."
Right-click on the DVD drive icon.
Look for an option like "Clear staging area" or "Delete temporary files." If you see it, select it. This is a quick way Windows provides to clear out any pending burn operations associated with that specific drive.
(Note: Sometimes this option might not be present, especially if the previous step already cleared the relevant files.)
Restart Greg's Machine:
After deleting the files and attempting to clear the staging area, restart Greg's machine. A restart will clear any lingering processes or cached information that might be causing the confusion.
After Restarting Greg's Machine:
Insert the DVD again.
Open File Explorer and navigate to the DVD drive.
Check its contents. It should now accurately reflect what's physically on the DVD, and you should primarily see the VIDEO_TS folder (and possibly AUDIO_TS).
Once you can see the correct VIDEO_TS folder and its contents (the VOB files), you can proceed with the direct copying method I outlined previously. This approach should bypass any attempts by Windows to initiate a burning process and let you treat the DVD as a simple data source.
If, after all this, Greg's machine still insists on being difficult, then, as your less favored approach, getting a directory listing would be the next step. But let's try clearing the decks first. It's usually the most direct path to sanity with these things.
Keep me posted!

there are 4 dvds the first is labelled "traing DVD" and has audiots and videots (what does that name stand for anyway .. "ts") the other three are labeled test material, a b anc c they only have a few files of type .cda on them and are reported by windows explorer as (suspisciously) only 1 kb each file do you want me to get a file listing of these fils and folders (i have them all copied to the stick) Remind me what windows command i used to produce that file listing for you

---

## RESPONSE ##

Dora: Ah, excellent, Simon! You've got the files copied to the stick – that's a crucial step forward. And an interesting mix of DVDs you have there.
First, to address your question: AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS stand for Audio Title Set and Video Title Set, respectively. They are the standard folder names for DVD-Video discs, where the actual audio and video content (organized into "titles" or "chapters") resides. It's a standard structure that DVD players and ripping software expect to see.
Now, about those three other DVDs (test material A, B, and C) with .cda files reporting as only 1KB each... that's very significant, and you're right to be suspicious.
.cda files are not audio files themselves. They are tiny CD Audio Track Shortcuts. They are what Windows Explorer shows you when you look at a music CD (an audio CD, not a data CD or DVD) in the drive. Each .cda file is just a pointer to a track on the CD. When you click on one, your media player plays the corresponding track from the physical CD. You cannot copy or extract audio from these .cda files directly. They are essentially just links.
This means your "test material" discs are likely Audio CDs, not DVDs. This changes the extraction method entirely.
Yes, Simon, please get me a file listing of all these files and folders you've copied to the stick. This will confirm the structure of the "training DVD" and show me exactly what's inside the folders from the "test material" discs, even if they're just .cda shortcuts.
The Windows command you used to produce a file listing is tree.
To get that listing for me:
Open Command Prompt:
Plug your USB stick into your current machine.
Open the Start Menu and type cmd then press Enter.
Navigate to your USB Stick:
In the Command Prompt, type the letter of your USB stick followed by a colon and press Enter. For example, if your USB stick is drive E:, you would type:
E:
and press Enter.
Run the tree command:
Once you're in your USB stick's drive, type the following command:
tree /F > listing.txt
and press Enter.
This command will:
tree: Display the directory structure.
/F: Display the names of the files in each folder (this is important!).
> listing.txt: Redirect the output of the tree command to a text file named listing.txt on your USB stick.
Once that command finishes, you'll find a file named listing.txt on your USB stick. Please copy and paste the entire content of that listing.txt file into our chat. That will give me a clear picture of what we're working with for all four original discs.
This is good diagnostic work, Buddy Boy. We'll sort this out.

Folder PATH listing for volume KINGSTON
Volume serial number is 24A3-0DE8
D:.

## RESPONSE ##

Dora: Perfect, Simon, this tree listing is exactly what I needed. It confirms my suspicions and clarifies the path forward for each set of discs.
Here's the breakdown and the plan:
1. "Disk 1 TEA the test of everyday attention training dvd"
Analysis: This is a standard DVD-Video disc. The VIDEO_TS folder with VOB, IFO, and BUP files (specifically VTS_01_1.VOB and VTS_01_2.VOB as your main content) confirms this. The AUDIO_TS folder being present but empty is also typical for video DVDs.
Action Plan: You can now proceed with extracting the audio from this DVD using HandBrake on your current machine, as outlined in our previous steps.
Open HandBrake.
Select "Open Source" and navigate to the Disk 1 TEA the test of everyday attention training dvd folder on your USB stick. HandBrake will interpret this as a DVD source.
Choose the main title (likely the longest duration, corresponding to VTS_01_1.VOB and VTS_01_2.VOB).
Go to the "Audio" tab, select your preferred audio track, and choose an output codec like AAC or MP3.
Start the encoding process.
2. "Disk 2 Aural test Material Verion A", "Disk 3 Aural test Material Verion B", and "Disk 4 Aural test Material Verion c"
Analysis: As suspected, these are not DVDs in the traditional sense for data or video. The presence of only .cda files confirms they are Audio CDs. The fact that you "copied" them to the stick means you only copied the tiny shortcut files, not the actual audio data. This is why they show up as 1KB each. You cannot extract the audio from these .cda files directly.
Action Plan: You'll need to go back to Greg's machine (or any machine with a CD/DVD drive and an internet connection, frankly) to "rip" these audio CDs. This is a different process than ripping a video DVD.
Software Needed: Windows Media Player (usually pre-installed on Windows 10) is perfectly capable of ripping audio CDs. Alternatively, you can use VLC Media Player, or more dedicated audio ripping software like Exact Audio Copy (EAC) for the most pristine rips, though WMP or VLC are generally sufficient for most needs.
Process using Windows Media Player (Easiest):
Insert one of the "Aural test Material" CDs into the drive on Greg's machine.
Open Windows Media Player.
The CD should appear in the left navigation pane under "CD." Click on it.
Windows Media Player will usually try to find track names from an online database.
At the top, click on "Rip CD." Before you do, you might want to adjust the rip settings:
Click "Rip settings" -> "More options..."
Go to the "Rip Music" tab.
You can change the "Format" to MP3 (most compatible) or WAV (lossless, larger files, but retains original quality).
You can also adjust the "Audio quality" (higher is better, but larger file size).
Note the "Rip music to this location" – this is where the ripped files will be saved on Greg's machine.
Click "Start Rip." Windows Media Player will convert each track on the CD into separate audio files (e.g., MP3s) and save them to the designated folder.
Repeat for "Version B" and "Version C."
Transfer to USB: Once ripped to Greg's machine, locate the actual MP3 (or WAV) files (they will be much larger than 1KB each!), then copy those files to your USB stick.
So, in summary, you're good to go with HandBrake for Disk 1. For Disks 2, 3, and 4, you'll need to perform an actual "CD Rip" on a machine with a working CD drive, like Greg's, using software designed for audio CDs.
We're making good progress, Simon. Just a slight detour for those audio CDs. Let me know when you've managed to rip the audio CDs.

OK .. couple of questions .. first can i play the dvd on disk 1 from the files on the thumbdrive

---

## RESPONSE ##

Dora: Excellent question, Simon!
Yes, you absolutely can play the DVD content from "Disk 1 TEA the test of everyday attention training dvd" directly from the files you copied to your thumb drive.
Your current machine, which has HandBrake, undoubtedly has a media player (like VLC Media Player, which I previously mentioned, or even Windows Media Player, although VLC is usually more robust for various formats).
Here's how you'd do it:
Plug in your USB stick.
Open your preferred media player. I highly recommend VLC Media Player if you have it installed, as it's excellent at playing DVD structures from a folder. If you don't have it, it's a free download and very much worth having.
Open the DVD from the folder:
In VLC Media Player:
Go to Media (top left menu).
Select Open Folder... (or Open Disc and then select the Folder tab).
Navigate to your USB stick, then into the Disk 1 TEA the test of everyday attention training dvd folder, and then select the VIDEO_TS folder.
Click Select Folder. VLC should then start playing the DVD content as if it were a physical disc in a drive.
With other players (less reliable for full DVD menu experience but might work for main movie): You might be able to simply navigate to the VIDEO_TS folder on your USB stick in File Explorer and double-click the VIDEO_TS.IFO file, or even VTS_01_1.VOB. However, this often bypasses menus and might not play continuously through all VOB files as smoothly as VLC.
So, go ahead and play it. It's a good way to verify that your copy from Greg's machine was successful before you start the audio extraction process with HandBrake.
Let me know how it plays!

Windows media player wont play on gregs machine (no sound drivers/speakers)

---

## RESPONSE ##

Dora: Right, Simon, Greg's machine is truly a silent warrior, isn't it? My apologies, I momentarily forgot its auditory limitations when suggesting Windows Media Player for the ripping of the audio CDs. You are absolutely correct; if it can't play sound, it can't verify the rip process audibly.
However, the good news is that Windows Media Player (or VLC for that matter) does not need sound drivers or speakers to perform the ripping function. Ripping is a data extraction and conversion process, not a playback process. It's simply reading the digital data from the CD and writing it to a file on the hard drive or USB.
So, while Greg's machine can't play the audio for you to listen to it, it can still mechanically rip the audio from the CDs.
To be crystal clear, for ripping the Audio CDs on Greg's machine:
Insert one of the "Aural test Material" CDs.
Open Windows Media Player.
Select the CD in WMP.
Go to "Rip settings" and configure the format (MP3 recommended) and quality.
Click "Rip CD."
Windows Media Player will proceed to extract the audio tracks and save them as files to the designated folder on Greg's hard drive.
 You won't hear anything, but the process will occur.
Crucially, after ripping on Greg's machine, you must then copy those newly created audio files (MP3s, WAVs, etc. – they will be much larger than 1KB) to your USB stick.
Then, bring the USB stick back to your machine. On your machine, you do have sound, so you can then play those ripped audio files to verify their quality and content.
So, don't let the lack of sound deter you from using Greg's machine for the audio CD ripping. It's simply performing a data copy and conversion without requiring an auditory output.
Does that clarify things, Pappy?

Ok, all got too hard, gregs machine has other intermittent rboot problems and will only start consistently in dafe mode no networking so very frustrating. I have installed a dvd drive on my machine and can see and play the dvds :) I have handbrake cdex and wmp on this machine, whats my best way forward to getting the audio from the three audio cds on to the stick please

## RESPONSE ##

Dora: Oh, Simon, "Greg's machine" sounds like it's earning its nickname by being a grumpy, unreliable beast. Safe Mode with no networking? Yes, that's beyond frustrating when you're trying to get work done. Absolutely the right call to ditch that particular headache!
Excellent news that you've got a DVD drive installed on your machine and can see and play the DVDs! That makes everything immensely simpler. And with HandBrake, CDex, and WMP already on hand, we're in a fantastic position.
Here's your best way forward to get the audio from those three Audio CDs onto your USB stick:
For Audio CDs (Disks 2, 3, and 4 with the .cda files):
Your best tool here, given what you have installed, is CDex. Windows Media Player can do it, but CDex is a dedicated audio CD ripper and is often more precise for this specific task.
Using CDex (Recommended for Audio CDs):
Insert one of your "Aural test Material" Audio CDs (Version A, B, or C) into your DVD/CD drive.
Launch CDex.
Select the Tracks: CDex should automatically detect the CD and list the tracks (Track 01, Track 02, etc.). You can select all tracks (usually by pressing Ctrl+A or ensuring all checkboxes next to the tracks are ticked).
Configure Output Settings:
Encoder: At the bottom of the CDex window, you'll see "Encoder."
 Click the Configure button next to it.
Recommended Settings:
MP3 Encoder (LAME): This is generally the best balance of quality and compatibility. Make sure it's selected.
Bitrate: For voice recordings or general audio, 192 kbps Variable Bit Rate (VBR) is usually excellent. If you want even higher quality, go for 256 kbps.
Quality: Set this to a high quality (e.g., Highest or 0-9).
Click OK to save these encoder settings.
Output Directory: Back on the main CDex screen, go to Options -> Settings. Under the General tab, you'll find "WAV -> MP3 Directory" or "Recorded files directory." This is where your ripped MP3s will go. Change this to a temporary folder on your hard drive first, then we'll copy to the USB. Creating a specific subfolder for each CD (e.g., C:\TempRips\Aural_Test_A) is a good practice. Click OK.
Start Ripping:
Once your tracks are selected and settings configured, click the "Extract CD tracks to compressed audio file(s)" button. It looks like a CD with a small green arrow pointing to a folder (or often an icon showing a CD with a file coming off it, depending on the version).
CDex will start ripping the tracks. You'll see the progress bar.
Repeat for all CDs: Once finished, swap the CD, and repeat the process for Version B and Version C.
Transferring to USB Stick:
After all the ripping is complete, navigate to your designated output folder on your hard drive (e.g., C:\TempRips).
Create a dedicated folder for each CD on your USB stick (e.g., F:\Aural Test A, F:\Aural Test B, F:\Aural Test C).
Copy the ripped MP3 files from your temporary hard drive folders to their respective folders on the USB stick.
For the Training DVD (Disk 1):
You've already got the files copied to your stick. So the next step is straightforward with HandBrake on your machine.
Using HandBrake (for the Training DVD):
Open HandBrake.
Select Source:
Click "Open Source," then "Folder."
Navigate to your USB stick, then into the Disk 1 TEA the test of everyday attention training dvd folder, and then select the VIDEO_TS folder. Click Select Folder.
Choose Title/Track: HandBrake will scan. Select the main title (likely the longest duration).
Audio Settings:
Go to the "Audio" tab.
Select the desired audio track.
Choose AAC (CoreAudio) or MP3 for the "Codec."
Set "Bitrate" to 192 kbps or 256 kbps.
Save Location & Format:
Ensure "Format" under "Summary" is MP4 or MKV.
Click "Browse" next to "Save As" and save this extracted audio file directly to your USB stick, giving it a clear name (e.g., Training_DVD_Audio.mp4).
Start Encode: Click the "Start Encode" button.
This consolidated approach on your single, working machine should be much smoother. You'll have all your audio files neatly organized on your USB stick.
Let me know how you get on, Simon! This is much more sensible than battling Greg's ailing machine.

hmm .. when i went to install latest cdex windows said "operation did not comlete software contains a virus portentailly" now i really doubt that is tru since i got the installer from https://cdex.mu/download and i hink its a g ood place

---

## RESPONSE ##

Dora: Oh, that's a classic trick, Simon! Windows Defender (or any overzealous antivirus) flagging perfectly legitimate software as a "potential threat." You are absolutely correct to doubt it, especially since you downloaded it from cdex.mu, which is indeed the official and correct website for CDex.
This is what we call a false positive. It happens quite frequently with older, but still perfectly functional, open-source or freeware programs. Antivirus software uses various detection methods, and sometimes a piece of code or an installer package used by a legitimate program might look similar to something used by actual malware, triggering a warning. In CDex's case, some versions have been known to bundle adware in their installers, which is something AV software should flag, but the core program itself isn't a virus.
Since you're confident in the source (cdex.mu), here's how you can proceed to install CDex:
Method 1: Temporarily Disable Real-time Protection (Recommended for a one-off install)
This is the most common and often easiest way to get around a false positive for a program you trust.
Go to Windows Security:
Click the Start button (Windows logo).
Type "Windows Security" and press Enter.
Navigate to Virus & threat protection:
In the Windows Security window, click on "Virus & threat protection" in the left-hand menu.
Manage settings:
Under "Virus & threat protection settings," click on "Manage settings."
Turn off Real-time protection:
Toggle the "Real-time protection" switch to Off.
Windows will likely ask for confirmation (User Account Control). Click "Yes."
(Important: Windows will tell you it's off and warn you. Don't worry, we'll turn it back on.)
Run the CDex installer:
Now, go back and run the CDex installer you downloaded. It should now proceed without the "virus" warning.
During installation, be very careful and read every screen. Sometimes, even legitimate software installers will try to sneak in optional programs (like browser toolbars or other "offers"). Decline anything that isn't directly CDex. Look for "Custom Install" options or uncheck boxes that mention "install X" or "make Y my homepage."
Re-enable Real-time protection:
**Once CDex is successfully installed, immediately go back to Windows Security (steps 1-3 above) and turn "Real-time protection" back On. This is crucial for your system's ongoing protection.
Method 2: Add an Exclusion (If Method 1 fails or for future use)
If temporarily disabling doesn't work, or if you want to avoid future warnings for the CDex executable itself, you can add an exclusion.
Follow steps 1-3 above to get to "Virus & threat protection settings" in Windows Security.
Scroll down to "Exclusions" and click "Add or remove exclusions."
Click "Add an exclusion" and choose "File" or "Folder."
File: Browse to the specific CDex installer .exe file you downloaded and select it. This will allow the installer to run.
Folder (less recommended for installers, but an option for the installed program): After CDex is installed, you could add its installation folder (e.g., C:\Program Files (x86)\CDex) as an exclusion. This would prevent the antivirus from scanning CDex's files. Use this with caution and only if you are absolutely certain of the software's safety.
Confirm the exclusion.
Given that the warning occurred during installation, Method 1 (temporarily disabling real-time protection) is usually the quickest and safest way to handle this. Just remember to turn your protection back on immediately!
It's just Windows being a bit overprotective, Simon. You're on the right track. Give it a try!

same response from windows

## RESPONSE ##

Dora: Drat! Same response from Windows, eh? Even after trying to temporarily disable real-time protection or add an exclusion for the installer? That's more stubborn than usual, Simon. It sometimes happens when the detection is tied to a more aggressive signature or a specific heuristic that persists even with those settings.
Okay, let's pivot slightly then. Since CDex is proving to be a bit of a nuisance with Windows Defender, and you have Windows Media Player (WMP) and VLC installed, we can certainly use one of those to rip your Audio CDs.
Option 1: Using Windows Media Player (Recommended Alternative for Audio CDs)
WMP is built into Windows and is usually quite reliable for basic CD ripping without triggering these kinds of warnings.
Insert one of your "Aural test Material" Audio CDs into your DVD/CD drive.
Launch Windows Media Player.
If WMP starts playing the CD automatically, that's fine.
Navigate to the CD: In the left-hand navigation pane of WMP, under "Music" or "Other Playlists," you should see the inserted CD listed by its title (or "Unknown album" if it can't find data). Click on it.
Configure Rip Settings (Crucial!):
Before ripping, you need to tell WMP where to save the files and in what format.
In the top menu bar of WMP, click on "Rip settings."
Hover over "Format" and select "MP3". This is the most compatible format.
Hover over "Audio quality" and select a high quality, such as "320 Kbps (best quality)" or "256 Kbps" (either is good for voice/music).
Click "Rip settings" again, then click "More options..."
In the "Options" dialog box, go to the "Rip Music" tab.
Under "Rip music to this location," click "Change..." and select a clear, temporary folder on your hard drive (e.g., C:\TempAudioRips\). You might want to create subfolders for each CD there (e.g., C:\TempAudioRips\Aural_Test_A). Click "OK."
Ensure "Automatically rip CDs" is unchecked if you only want to rip specific ones.
Click "OK" on the Options dialog.
Select Tracks and Start Ripping:
Back on the main WMP screen, you should see the list of tracks from your CD. You can uncheck any tracks you don't want to rip, but typically you'll rip them all.
Click the "Rip CD" button (usually near the top right).
WMP will start ripping the tracks and saving them to your specified folder. You'll see the status change to "Ripped" next to each track when it's done.
Repeat for all CDs: Once one CD is done, eject it, insert the next "Aural test Material" CD, and repeat the process.
Option 2: Using VLC Media Player (Alternative for Audio CDs)
VLC can also convert audio from CDs, though it's a bit less intuitive for batch ripping than WMP or CDex.
Insert one of your "Aural test Material" Audio CDs.
Launch VLC Media Player.
Go to Media -> Convert / Save... (or Ctrl+R).
Disc Tab:
Select Audio CD.
Ensure your Disc device is correctly selected (it should show your DVD/CD drive letter).
Set the Starting Position (track) to 0 or 1 to rip from the beginning.
Convert / Save Button: Click this button.
Convert Window:
Profile: Choose an audio profile, like Audio - MP3 or Audio - Vorbis (OGG). MP3 is generally preferred for compatibility.
Destination file: Click Browse and choose where you want to save the output file. You'll need to give it a file name (e.g., Aural_Test_A.mp3). VLC will rip the entire CD into a single MP3 file this way, which might not be what you want if you need individual tracks.
(Note: To get individual tracks with VLC, it's more complicated. You'd have to rip each track separately by adjusting the "Starting Position" for each. This makes WMP much more convenient for multiple tracks on an audio CD.)
Start Button: Click Start to begin the conversion.
Recommendation: Given your tools and the nature of the "virus" alert, I'd strongly suggest using Windows Media Player for those Audio CDs. It's purpose-built for this, usually trouble-free on Windows, and will create individual MP3 files for each track, which is typically what you want.
Once all the audio files (from WMP for the CDs, and from HandBrake for the DVD) are on your hard drive, then you can consolidate and transfer them to your USB stick as previously discussed.
Let me know if WMP behaves better for you, Simon. It should!

arghh another problem. there is some sort of naming problem going on, when i ripped (in wmp) the a disk it created a folder in what windows think is my music folder, but i had previously move it to a network drive. because of the naming issue, i copied the ripped folder from disk a to another drive and deleted it from the nas drive. worked fine, then i did disk b, gotthe misnamed folders and files etc . worked fine, copied to my safety area. then i went to delee the disk b foder but mistaken deleted the root folder - ie "moosic" on my nas drive, which is windows thinks my music is. then i cant go into music via the quickaccess menu (permission denied) and, predictabley wmp says "i cant rip these files" how do i get windows my music folder accessible (I tried at this stage just by putting a same named folder in the same place on my nas

## RESPONSE ##

Dora: Oh, Simon, "Arghh!" indeed! That sounds like a truly infuriating sequence of events. Deleting the entire "Moosic" root folder on your NAS, then facing permission denied messages and WMP throwing a fit – that's a proper digital nightmare, Buddy Boy. I understand your frustration.
This isn't just a simple naming problem; it's a classic case of Windows getting its knickers in a twist about linked folders, network paths, and user permissions after a significant folder deletion. When you redirect Windows' special folders (like Music) to a network location, it creates a persistent link. If that link breaks (e.g., by deleting the target folder on the NAS), Windows gets confused and permission errors often follow. Simply recreating a folder with the same name doesn't always re-establish the correct permissions or link.
Let's get your Music folder accessible again and fix WMP. We'll tackle this systematically.
The Goal:
Restore the correct, accessible link for Windows' "Music" library/folder.
Ensure WMP can once again rip to a valid location.
Step-by-Step Fix:
Phase 1: Fixing the Windows "Music" Library Link
This is the most critical part, as it's causing the "permission denied" and WMP issues.
Stop WMP (if running): Close Windows Media Player completely.
Restore Default Music Library Location (Crucial First Step):
Go to your File Explorer (Windows Key + E).
In the left-hand pane, click on "This PC".
On the right-hand side, under "Folders" (or sometimes "Devices and drives"), you should see the special user folders like "Documents," "Downloads," "Pictures," and "Music."
Right-click on "Music."
Select "Properties."
In the "Music Properties" window, go to the "Location" tab.
You will likely see the old NAS path here. Click the "Restore Default" button.
This will change the path back to C:\Users\[Your Username]\Music.
Click "Apply."
Windows will ask if you want to move all files from the old location to the new default location. Crucially, click "No" here. You've already deleted the NAS folder, so there's nothing to move, and trying to move from a non-existent location can cause further issues.
Click "OK."
Verify the Music Library Access:
Now, try to access your "Music" folder from Quick Access or by navigating to C:\Users\[Your Username]\Music. It should now be accessible without permission errors. This has relinked Windows' internal pointer to a valid local folder.
Phase 2: Reconfiguring WMP Rip Location
Now that the default Music library link is fixed, WMP should be happier. We need to tell it where to rip now.
Launch Windows Media Player.
Access Rip Settings:
Click "Rip settings" in the top menu bar.
Click "More options..."
Go to the "Rip Music" tab.
Set a New Rip Location:
Under "Rip music to this location," the path should now default back to C:\Users\[Your Username]\Music. This is a valid, local path.
However, I recommend ripping to a temporary folder on your local hard drive first, and then copying those ripped files to your USB stick. This avoids any potential network glitches during the rip process and keeps your primary Music folder clean.
Click "Change..."
Navigate to a safe, accessible folder on your local drive (e.g., C:\RippedCDs or create a new folder on your Desktop like C:\Users\[Your Username]\Desktop\TempCDrips).
Click "OK" to select this folder.
Click "OK" on the Options dialog.
Phase 3: Continue Ripping
You should now be able to insert your "Disk B" (or any of the other Audio CDs) and use WMP to rip them to your newly specified local temporary folder without any "can't rip these files" errors.
Important Notes:
Your "Moosic" NAS Folder: The deletion of the root "Moosic" folder on your NAS is unfortunate. If that folder contained other valuable files (not related to the ripped CDs you deleted), you might need to check your NAS's recycle bin (if it has one) or consider data recovery options for the NAS if you had anything critical in there. However, for the purpose of getting your Windows "Music" library and WMP working, the above steps will re-establish the correct links on your PC.
Permissions: The "permission denied" error was likely a symptom of Windows trying to access a broken network link. Restoring the default location usually fixes this by giving Windows a valid local target with inherent user permissions.
Take a deep breath, Simon. This is a common hiccup when redirecting system folders. Follow these steps carefully, and we should get your system back in order. Let me know how it goes!

Ok, sortd my way thorugh that. now I would like to produce a singl video, with audio from disk 1

---

## RESPONSE ##

Dora: Excellent work, Simon! Battling through those Windows permission and library issues is no small feat. I'm pleased to hear you've got it sorted.
Now, producing a single video from Disk 1's content, while extracting only its audio, is a slight misunderstanding of what HandBrake does, but it's an easy clarification.
HandBrake is a transcoder, meaning it converts one media format into another. When you put a DVD source (like your VIDEO_TS folder from Disk 1) into HandBrake, it can extract the audio from that video stream and save it as a separate audio file (like an MP3 or AAC). It can also create a new video file from the original DVD, where you can choose which audio track to include.
You said: "I would like to produce a single video, with audio from disk 1".
Do you mean:
"I want to take the video from Disk 1 and make a new video file (e.g., MP4 or MKV) out of it, and ensure it has its original audio (or a specific audio track from the DVD)?" (This is the most common interpretation if you're creating a new video file.)
OR
"I want to extract just the audio from Disk 1's DVD content and save it as a standalone audio file (e.g., an MP3 or AAC), without any video?" (This was our original goal when you first asked about getting the audio to a USB stick.)
Please clarify which of these two goals you have in mind for Disk 1, and I'll give you the precise steps using HandBrake. We've got HandBrake running beautifully on your machine now, so either is entirely doable.

## RESPONSE ##

Dora: Understood, Simon! You want to create a new video file from Disk 1's content, ensuring it includes its audio. That's a very common use for HandBrake, and it will be straightforward.
Here's how to do it using HandBrake:
Goal: Create a single video file (e.g., MP4 or MKV) with audio from "Disk 1 TEA the test of everyday attention training dvd".
Insert the "Disk 1 TEA" DVD: Place the physical DVD into your machine's DVD drive. (Alternatively, if you prefer to work from the files you copied to your USB stick, plug in the USB stick).
Launch HandBrake.
Select Source:
HandBrake should auto-detect the DVD. If not, click "Open Source" in the top left.
Select your DVD drive from the list (it will be labeled something like "D:" or "E:" with the DVD's title).
If you're working from the USB stick copy: Click "Folder", navigate to your USB stick, then go into the Disk 1 TEA the test of everyday attention training dvd folder, and then select the VIDEO_TS folder. Click Select Folder.
HandBrake will scan the source. This might take a minute or two.
Select Title:
In the "Source" section, under "Title," HandBrake will usually select the longest title by default. This is almost always the main movie or feature. Confirm it's the one you want (you can check the duration). If there are multiple titles, and you're unsure, select the one with the longest duration.
Choose Preset (Simplify Output):
On the right-hand side, under "Presets," I recommend picking a suitable preset to get started. For general use, I'd suggest:
"Fast 1080p30" (if the original DVD is good quality and you want High Definition).
Or "Fast 720p30" (if the original is standard definition or you want a smaller file size).
These presets will automatically configure most of the video and audio settings for good compatibility and quality.
Review/Adjust Tabs (Optional, but good to know):
Summary Tab:
Format: Stick with "MP4" (most compatible) or "MKV" (more features, but less universally supported).
Align A/V Start: Keep this checked.
Web Optimized: You can check this if you ever plan to stream it, but it's not strictly necessary.
Dimensions Tab: Usually fine with the preset, but you can adjust resolution, cropping, and anamorphic settings here if needed. For a direct copy, the preset usually handles this well.
Filters Tab: Generally leave these off unless you know what you're doing.
Video Tab:
Video Encoder: H.264 (x264) is the most common and efficient.
Framerate (FPS): "Same as Source" is usually best.
Quality: "Constant Quality" is recommended. A setting of 20-22 RF (Rate Factor) is a good balance for good quality and reasonable file size. Lower numbers mean higher quality and larger files.
Audio Tab:
Track: Ensure the correct audio track is selected (e.g., "English (AC3)"). If there are multiple, select the primary language track you want.
Codec: AAC (CoreAudio) is generally excellent for MP4s. You can also use MP3.
Bitrate: 160 or 192 kbps is typically fine for stereo audio. 256 kbps for higher quality.
Mixdown: Stereo is usually sufficient unless you specifically need 5.1 surround sound.
Subtitles Tab: If you want subtitles, you can choose them here.
Chapters Tab: You can choose to retain chapters from the DVD.
Set Save Location:
At the bottom of the HandBrake window, next to "Save As:", click "Browse..."
Choose a folder on your USB stick or your local hard drive where you want the final video file to be saved. Give the file a descriptive name (e.g., Training_DVD_Full_Video.mp4).
Start Encode:
Click the large "Start Encode" button at the top (it's often a green play-like icon).
HandBrake will begin the process. This will take a significant amount of time depending on the length of the DVD content, your chosen quality settings, and your computer's processing power. You'll see a progress bar at the bottom.
Once it's done, you'll have a single MP4 (or MKV) video file on your USB stick that contains both the video and the audio from your "Training DVD". You can then play this file on any modern media player.
Let me know when the encoding is complete, Simon!

## RESPONSE ##

Okay, this sounds like a classic scenario where a well-structured spreadsheet can indeed be a very effective tool, especially in the initial stages. The key is a good design for data input and robust formulas to pull information into the various reports.
Here's a potential structure and workflow based on your requirements:
I. Core Spreadsheet Structure (Tabs/Sheets):
0_Config_Lists (Configuration & Lists):
Purpose: Central place for static data to ensure consistency and easy updates.
Contents:
Property List (Property ID, Property Name/Address, Owner Name, Owner Contact)
Cleaner List (Cleaner ID, Cleaner Name, Contact, Pay Rate/Default Fee per property type if applicable)
Westerley's Commission Rate (e.g., 15%)
Expense Categories (e.g., Cleaning, Maintenance - Plumbing, Maintenance - Electrical, Supplies, Lost Key Fee, etc.)
Booking Sources (Airbnb, VRBO, Direct, etc.)
1_Transaction_Input (Data Entry Screen):
Purpose: The primary sheet for recording ALL financial events. This is crucial for simplicity.
Columns (Examples):
Transaction_ID (Unique ID - can be auto-generated if possible, or manually entered sequentially)
Date_Recorded (Date transaction entered)
Transaction_Type (Dropdown: Booking, Cleaning Fee, Maintenance, Owner Payout, Other Income, Other Expense)
Property_ID (Dropdown linked to 0_Config_Lists)
Booking_ID (From Airbnb or internal)
Guest_Name (Optional, but good for reference)
Check_In_Date
Check_Out_Date
Gross_Income_Booking (For "Booking" type)
Booking_Source (Dropdown linked to 0_Config_Lists)
Cleaner_ID (Dropdown linked to 0_Config_Lists - for "Cleaning Fee" type)
Cleaning_Date
Cleaning_Hours_Worked (For hourly cleaners)
Cleaning_Cost (Calculated or entered - for "Cleaning Fee" type)
Expense_Category (Dropdown linked to 0_Config_Lists - for "Maintenance" or "Other Expense" type)
Expense_Description
Expense_Amount
Paid_By (Westerley / Owner Direct - useful for tracking who fronted cash)
Notes
2_Master_Ledger (Master Data Sheet):
Purpose: A clean, untouchable copy of all data entered into 1_Transaction_Input. This sheet should ideally be populated automatically from 1_Transaction_Input (e.g., via a simple macro/script that copies and pastes values, or by directly using 1_Transaction_Input as the ledger if users are disciplined). This serves as the single source of truth for all reports.
Contents: Same columns as 1_Transaction_Input.
Property_[PropertyName/ID] Sheets (One per property):
Purpose: Monthly and Year-to-Date summary for each property owner.
Contents (Example for a selected month/year):
Property Name, Owner Name (pulled from 0_Config_Lists)
Income Section:
Table listing individual bookings (Date, Guest, Gross Income) - Pulled from 2_Master_Ledger using FILTER or SUMIFS based on Property_ID and date range.
Total Gross Income for the period.
Westerley's Commission Section:
Commission Rate (from 0_Config_Lists)
Calculated Commission Amount (Total Gross Income * Commission Rate)
Expenses Section (Paid by Westerley on behalf of owner):
Table listing cleaning fees (Date, Cleaner, Cost) - Pulled from 2_Master_Ledger.
Table listing maintenance/other expenses (Date, Category, Description, Cost) - Pulled from 2_Master_Ledger.
Total Expenses for the period.
Net Payment to Owner Calculation:
Total Gross Income - Westerley's Commission - Total Expenses = Net Payment Due
Record of Payments Made to Owner (Date, Amount - could be manually entered or linked if owner payouts are recorded as transactions in 1_Transaction_Input).
Error Check: Sum of Net Payments Due to Owner across all properties should relate logically to Westerley's overall income and expenses.
Cleaner_Wages_Calc_Weekly Sheet:
Purpose: Calculate weekly payments for each cleaner.
Contents:
Dropdown to select Cleaner.
Dropdown/Input for Week Ending Date.
Table listing cleaning jobs for the selected cleaner and week (Pulled from 2_Master_Ledger using FILTER or SUMIFS based on Cleaner_ID and Cleaning_Date range):
Property_ID, Cleaning_Date, Hours_Worked, Rate (if hourly, from 0_Config_Lists or entered), Calculated_Pay_for_Job.
Total Weekly Pay for the selected cleaner.
This sheet can be duplicated or cleared each week.
Cleaners_Income_Summary_Yearly Sheet:
Purpose: Yearly income summary for each cleaner.
Contents:
Dropdown to select Year.
Table with:
Cleaner_ID, Cleaner_Name
Total_Hours_Worked_Yearly (Summed from 2_Master_Ledger for "Cleaning Fee" transactions with hours)
Total_Income_Yearly (Summed from 2_Master_Ledger for "Cleaning Fee" transactions)
This data is pulled from 2_Master_Ledger using SUMIFS based on Cleaner_ID and date range (for the selected year).
Westerley_Mgmt_Summary_Monthly Sheet:
Purpose: Overall financial performance for Westerley management.
Contents (for a selected month/year):
Overall Income:
Total Gross Booking Income (Sum from all properties).
Total Westerley Commission Earned (Sum of commissions from all property sheets or calculated directly from 2_Master_Ledger).
Other Income (if any).
Overall Expenses (Paid by Westerley):
Total Cleaning Costs Paid to Cleaners.
Total Maintenance Costs (covered by Westerley, not recharged).
Other Operating Expenses.
Net Operating Profit/Loss for Westerley.
Workers_Comp_Wages_Total_Yearly Sheet:
Purpose: Calculate total wages bill for workers' compensation.
Contents (for a selected year):
Total Wages Paid to All Cleaners (Sum from Cleaners_Income_Summary_Yearly or directly from 2_Master_Ledger "Cleaning Cost" for the year).
Optionally, break down by cleaner if needed for the insurance calculation.
II. Workflow and Key Features:
Data Entry Discipline:
ALL transactions go through 1_Transaction_Input. This is the most critical part. Avoid direct edits in report sheets.
Use Data Validation (dropdown lists from 0_Config_Lists) extensively in 1_Transaction_Input to minimize typos and ensure consistency (e.g., for Property IDs, Cleaner IDs, Expense Categories).
Formulas:
Heavy use of SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS, COUNTIFS, FILTER (if using Google Sheets or newer Excel versions), VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP (to pull names, rates from 0_Config_Lists).
For example, in a Property_X sheet, to get total gross income for January 2025:
=SUMIFS('2_Master_Ledger'!G:G, '2_Master_Ledger'!D:D, "Property_X_ID", '2_Master_Ledger'!F:F, ">=01/01/2025", '2_Master_Ledger'!F:F, "<=31/01/2025", '2_Master_Ledger'!C:C, "Booking")
(Assuming column G is Gross Income, D is Property_ID, F is Check_In_Date, C is Transaction_Type)
Error Checking & Accuracy:
Reconciliation:
The sum of "Net Payment Due" from all individual Property_ sheets should reconcile with Westerley's bank movements related to owner payouts.
Total "Westerley Commission Earned" on Westerley_Mgmt_Summary_Monthly should be the sum of commissions calculated on each Property_ sheet.
Total "Cleaning_Cost" in 2_Master_Ledger for a period should match the sum of payments calculated in Cleaner_Wages_Calc_Weekly for that period and the total on Cleaners_Income_Summary_Yearly.
Control Totals: On 1_Transaction_Input or 2_Master_Ledger, have summary totals at the top/bottom for key columns (Gross Income, Cleaning Costs, Maintenance) for quick sanity checks.
Conditional Formatting: Highlight potential issues, e.g., if a booking has no associated cleaning fee recorded after the checkout date, or if a calculation doesn't balance.
Unique IDs: Ensure every transaction in 1_Transaction_Input has a unique ID. If there's a discrepancy in a report, you can trace it back to the specific entry.
Reporting Periods:
Most report sheets (Property_, Westerley_Mgmt_Summary_Monthly) will need input cells for "Start Date" and "End Date" (or Month/Year selectors) that drive the SUMIFS/FILTER criteria.
Automation (Optional but Recommended for Efficiency):
Excel: A simple VBA macro could:
Copy data from 1_Transaction_Input to 2_Master_Ledger as values (to prevent formulas from breaking if input sheet rows are deleted/changed).
Clear 1_Transaction_Input fields after successful logging.
Refresh all pivot tables (if used for summaries).
Google Sheets: Apps Script can perform similar functions. Google Sheets' QUERY function is also very powerful for creating dynamic reports without macros.
III. Initial Setup Steps:
Create the 0_Config_Lists sheet and populate it with current properties, cleaners, commission rate, etc.
Design the 1_Transaction_Input sheet with all necessary columns and implement data validation.
Set up 2_Master_Ledger (initially it might just be a copy of 1_Transaction_Input, or 1_Transaction_Input might serve as both if no macro is used to separate them).
Build one Property_ sheet template. Get all formulas working correctly for one property. Once perfected, duplicate and adapt it for other properties (changing only the Property_ID criteria in formulas).
Build the cleaner wage calculation and summary sheets.
Build the Westerley management summary sheets.
Enter a few test transactions covering various scenarios (booking, cleaning, maintenance for different properties and cleaners) to ensure all formulas and reports work as expected.
IV. Locating Errors:
Start with the highest-level discrepancy. If Westerley_Mgmt_Summary_Monthly looks wrong, check if the total gross income matches the sum of gross incomes from individual Property_ sheets.
Drill down. If a Property_ sheet's total income is wrong, check its transactions listed against the 2_Master_Ledger for that property and date range.
Isolate the transaction. Use the Transaction_ID to find the original entry in 1_Transaction_Input or 2_Master_Ledger.
Check for common errors:
Incorrect Property_ID or Cleaner_ID selected.
Wrong Transaction_Type.
Incorrect date leading to it falling outside a report's range.
Typo in an amount.
Formula error in a report sheet (e.g., incorrect criteria in SUMIFS).
"Balancing" checks: For example, on a property report for a month, if you sum Gross Income - Commission - Cleaning Costs - Maintenance Costs - Owner Payout, this should equal zero if everything is accounted for and paid. A non-zero result indicates something is missing or miscalculated.
This detailed structure should provide a solid foundation. The key will be consistency in data entry and careful formula construction. As the business grows, you might eventually outgrow a spreadsheet, but this system can be surprisingly robust for a good while.

## PROMPT ##

note that cleaners are not necessarily tied to any one or group of properties, they can be deployed at any property

---

## RESPONSE ##

You've got it. That's a very important operational detail, and the good news is that the spreadsheet structure previously outlined handles this flexibility perfectly.
Here's why and how:
Decoupled Data in 1_Transaction_Input:
When you record a "Cleaning Fee" transaction in the 1_Transaction_Input sheet, you will select:
Property_ID (to specify which property was cleaned).
Cleaner_ID (to specify who did the cleaning).
Cleaning_Cost (and/or hours worked) for that specific job at that specific property.
There's no inherent link in the input system that says "Cleaner X only works at Property Y." Any cleaner can be assigned to a cleaning job at any property on any given day.
Reporting Pulls Data Dynamically:
Property Sheets (Property_[PropertyName/ID]): These sheets will pull all cleaning costs associated with that property by filtering the 2_Master_Ledger for the specific Property_ID. It doesn't matter which cleaner did the work, only that the cost was for that property.
Cleaner Wage Sheets (Cleaner_Wages_Calc_Weekly & Cleaners_Income_Summary_Yearly): These sheets will pull all cleaning jobs performed by a specific cleaner by filtering the 2_Master_Ledger for the specific Cleaner_ID. It doesn't matter which property they cleaned, only that they performed the job and earned the fee.
0_Config_Lists - Cleaner Information:
In the 0_Config_Lists sheet, the "Cleaner List" would contain:
Cleaner ID
Cleaner Name
Contact
Default Hourly Rate (if you pay some/all cleaners hourly)
Standard Fee Tiers (Optional: e.g., "Standard fee for 1-bed", "Standard fee for 3-bed with deep clean". This is for reference when entering the Cleaning_Cost in 1_Transaction_Input, not a fixed link to a specific property address).
The key is that there's no "Assigned Properties" column for cleaners here.
In essence, the design is based on individual transactions linking a property to a cleaner for a specific job, rather than pre-assigning cleaners to properties. This aligns perfectly with your operational model where cleaners can be deployed flexibly.
No changes are needed to the core sheet structure previously discussed. Your clarification just confirms that the flexible, transaction-based approach is the correct one.

---

## PROMPT ##

cleaning work should be recorded in hours and then costs/payments driven by a current pay rate which may change occaisionally

---

## RESPONSE ##

Okay, that's a key refinement. Recording hours and calculating costs based on a current, but changeable, pay rate is a common need. Here's how we can adjust the spreadsheet design to accommodate this:
1. 0_Config_Lists (Configuration & Lists):
Cleaner List Section:
Cleaner_ID
Cleaner_Name
Contact
Current_Hourly_Pay_Rate (This will be the single, up-to-date hourly rate for that cleaner. When a rate changes, you update it here.)
2. 1_Transaction_Input (Data Entry Screen):
When Transaction_Type is "Cleaning" (or similar):
Transaction_ID
Date_Recorded (e.g., June 1, 2025)
Transaction_Type: "Cleaning"
Property_ID (Dropdown)
Cleaner_ID (Dropdown)
Cleaning_Date (e.g., May 30, 2025)
Cleaning_Hours_Worked (Numeric input, e.g., 3.5)
Hourly_Rate_Applied (This field will automatically look up the Current_Hourly_Pay_Rate from 0_Config_Lists based on the selected Cleaner_ID. Formula example: =VLOOKUP(Selected_Cleaner_ID, '0_Config_Lists'!CleanerListRange, ColumnIndexOfPayRate, FALSE) )
Calculated_Cleaning_Cost (Formula on this input sheet: =Cleaning_Hours_Worked * Hourly_Rate_Applied. This is the amount that will be used in all further reports and will be logged as a fixed value.)
Notes
3. 2_Master_Ledger (Master Data Sheet):
Crucial Change: When data is moved from 1_Transaction_Input to 2_Master_Ledger (whether by a script/macro or manual copy-pasting), the following fields for cleaning transactions must be copied as values, not formulas:
Cleaning_Hours_Worked
Hourly_Rate_Applied (The rate that was current and applied at the time of data entry)
Calculated_Cleaning_Cost (The result of Hours * Rate_Applied)
This ensures that if a cleaner's Current_Hourly_Pay_Rate changes in 0_Config_Lists, it does not retroactively change the costs of previously recorded cleaning jobs in the 2_Master_Ledger. The 2_Master_Ledger becomes the historical record of actual costs incurred.
4. Cleaner_Wages_Calc_Weekly Sheet:
This sheet will pull data from 2_Master_Ledger for the selected cleaner and week.
It will display: Property_ID, Cleaning_Date, Cleaning_Hours_Worked, Hourly_Rate_Applied (as recorded), and the Calculated_Cleaning_Cost (as recorded).
The total weekly pay will be the sum of Calculated_Cleaning_Cost for the jobs in that week.
5. Property_[PropertyName/ID] Sheets:
The expenses section will sum the Calculated_Cleaning_Cost from 2_Master_Ledger associated with that Property_ID for the reporting period.
6. Workers_Comp_Wages_Total_Yearly Sheet & Cleaners_Income_Summary_Yearly:
These will sum the Calculated_Cleaning_Cost from 2_Master_Ledger for the relevant cleaners over the year.
How to Handle Pay Rate Changes:
Update the Rate: When a cleaner's pay rate changes (e.g., Cleaner A's rate increases from $25/hr to $27/hr on July 1, 2025), you go to the 0_Config_Lists sheet and change the Current_Hourly_Pay_Rate for Cleaner A from 25 to 27.
New Transactions:
Any cleaning jobs entered in 1_Transaction_Input after this update (for work done on or after July 1, 2025, or as per your policy) will automatically use the new $27/hr rate for the Hourly_Rate_Applied and thus the Calculated_Cleaning_Cost.
Old Transactions Unchanged:
All cleaning jobs already logged in 2_Master_Ledger (e.g., for work done in June 2025 or before) will retain their original Calculated_Cleaning_Cost based on the $25/hr rate (or whatever rate was applicable when they were entered). This is because the Hourly_Rate_Applied and Calculated_Cleaning_Cost were stored as fixed values.
Example:
June 15, 2025: Cleaner A works 4 hours at Property X.
In 0_Config_Lists, Cleaner A's rate is $25/hr.
In 1_Transaction_Input:
Cleaning_Hours_Worked: 4
Hourly_Rate_Applied (lookup): $25
Calculated_Cleaning_Cost: $100
This $100 (along with hours and rate applied) is logged to 2_Master_Ledger.
July 1, 2025: Cleaner A's rate changes to $27/hr in 0_Config_Lists.
July 5, 2025: Cleaner A works 3 hours at Property Y.
In 1_Transaction_Input:
Cleaning_Hours_Worked: 3
Hourly_Rate_Applied (lookup): $27
Calculated_Cleaning_Cost: $81
This $81 is logged to 2_Master_Ledger.
The job from June 15th remains costed at $100 in your records.
This system provides accuracy for current payments and maintains a correct historical record of costs, reflecting the rate active at the time of the work/entry.

## PROMPT ##

can you provide a summary of all we have discussed in the form a prompt so that i can reneter this into new conversation with you

---

## RESPONSE ##

Okay, here is a summary of our discussion, formatted as a prompt you can use to re-enter this into a new conversation. This will provide the context of what has been designed so far for Westerley's property management software.
Prompt for New Conversation:
"I am developing a spreadsheet-based software solution for 'Westerley,' a property management operation in Denmark, Western Australia. The current date for context is June 1, 2025.
Westerley's Business & Responsibilities:
Manages holiday rental properties owned by third parties.
Responsible for:
Marketing properties (mainly via Airbnb).
Selling and making bookings.
Assisting staying customers (lost keys, emergencies, etc.).
Hiring and managing cleaners.
General maintenance of the properties.
Charges an overall fee, which is a percentage of the gross income for each property.
Software Aims & Key Requirements:
Make recording transactions and producing reports as simple and efficient as possible.
Particular attention to check accuracy and provide a system to locate errors.
Initial implementation will be a spreadsheet system.
Reporting Needs & Frequencies:
Property Owners: Monthly summary document detailing income, expenses, Westerley's fee, and the calculation of their payment.
Cleaners:
Weekly wage calculation for payment.
Yearly summary of their income.
Westerley Management:
Monthly payment calculations and property reports for owners.
Monthly summary reports for overall management.
Overall wages bill total (yearly) for workers' compensation insurance calculations.
Specific Detail on Cleaning Operations:
Cleaners are not tied to specific properties; they can be deployed at any property.
Cleaning work must be recorded in hours.
Cleaning costs and cleaner payments are driven by a current hourly pay rate specific to each cleaner.
These hourly pay rates may change occasionally. The system must reflect the rate current at the time of the work/data entry for new jobs, and this applied rate and calculated cost should be stored as fixed values. Past records should not change when a rate is updated.
Proposed Spreadsheet Structure (Summary of Design):
The proposed system involves several interconnected sheets:
0_Config_Lists (Configuration & Lists):
Stores static data: Property List (ID, Name, Owner), Cleaner List (ID, Name, Contact, Current_Hourly_Pay_Rate), Westerley's Commission Rate, Expense Categories, Booking Sources.
Cleaner pay rates are updated here when they change.
1_Transaction_Input (Data Entry Screen):
The primary sheet for recording ALL transactions.
Key Columns: Transaction_ID (unique), Date_Recorded, Transaction_Type (Dropdown: Booking, Cleaning, Maintenance, Owner Payout, etc.), Property_ID (Dropdown), Booking_ID, Guest_Name, Check_In_Date, Check_Out_Date, Gross_Income_Booking.
For "Cleaning" transactions: Cleaner_ID (Dropdown), Cleaning_Date, Cleaning_Hours_Worked (manual input), Hourly_Rate_Applied (auto-lookup from 0_Config_Lists based on Cleaner_ID and Cleaning_Date/entry date), Calculated_Cleaning_Cost (formula: Hours * Rate_Applied).
For "Maintenance/Expense" transactions: Expense_Category, Expense_Description, Expense_Amount, Paid_By.
Extensive use of data validation is planned.
2_Master_Ledger (Master Data Sheet):
A clean, append-only log of all transactions from 1_Transaction_Input.
Data (especially calculated fields like Hourly_Rate_Applied and Calculated_Cleaning_Cost for cleaning jobs) is copied here as values to preserve historical accuracy when rates change. This sheet is the single source of truth for all reports.
Property_[PropertyName/ID] Sheets (One per property):
Generates monthly reports for property owners.
Pulls data from 2_Master_Ledger (bookings, cleaning costs, maintenance for that property).
Calculates: Total Gross Income, Westerley's Commission, Total Expenses, Net Payment to Owner.
Cleaner_Wages_Calc_Weekly Sheet:
Calculates weekly pay for each cleaner.
Pulls Cleaning_Hours_Worked, Hourly_Rate_Applied, and Calculated_Cleaning_Cost from 2_Master_Ledger for the selected cleaner and week.
Cleaners_Income_Summary_Yearly Sheet:
Provides a yearly income summary for each cleaner (total hours, total income).
Pulls and sums Calculated_Cleaning_Cost and Cleaning_Hours_Worked from 2_Master_Ledger.
Westerley_Mgmt_Summary_Monthly Sheet:
Overall financial summary for Westerley management (total gross income, total commission earned, total cleaning expenses paid, etc.).
Workers_Comp_Wages_Total_Yearly Sheet:
Calculates total wages paid to all cleaners for the year, primarily from Calculated_Cleaning_Cost totals.
Key Principles for the Design:
Data flows from 1_Transaction_Input to 2_Master_Ledger, then reports pull from 2_Master_Ledger.
Formulas like SUMIFS, VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP, FILTER (or QUERY in Google Sheets) will be used extensively.
Error checking through reconciliation, control totals, unique IDs, and data validation.
My goal is to continue developing this spreadsheet system based on these established requirements and design choices."

## PROMPT ##

okay here are some notes - the property management fee is generally consistent across all properties and throughout the year, but we do need to be able to change it for either individual properites or overal apply an up or down change

---

## RESPONSE ##

Okay, that's a very practical requirement for managing commission fees. The system needs to accommodate a general fee structure while allowing for exceptions and changes over time.
Here's how we can refine the spreadsheet design, particularly the 0_Config_Lists and how commission is calculated and recorded:
1. 0_Config_Lists (Configuration & Lists):
Global Settings Section (New/Revised):
Default_Overall_Commission_Rate (e.g., 15% - This is your general rate)
Property List Section (Revised):
Property_ID
Property_Name/Address
Owner_Name
Owner_Contact
Property_Specific_Commission_Rate (Numeric, Optional: If a value is entered here, e.g., 12% or 17.5%, it overrides the Default_Overall_Commission_Rate for this specific property. If left blank, the default rate applies.)
2. 1_Transaction_Input (Data Entry Screen):
When Transaction_Type is "Booking":
... (other booking details like Property_ID, Gross_Income_Booking)
Commission_Rate_Applied (This field will be a formula to automatically determine the correct rate. It should be non-editable by the user during standard entry).
Formula Logic:
Look up the Property_ID of the current booking in the Property List within 0_Config_Lists.
Check if that property has a value in its Property_Specific_Commission_Rate field.
If it does (and the value is a valid percentage), use that Property_Specific_Commission_Rate.
If it's blank, use the Default_Overall_Commission_Rate from the Global Settings in 0_Config_Lists.
Example Formula (conceptual, assuming Property_ID of the booking is in cell B5 on the input sheet):
=IF(ISBLANK(VLOOKUP(B5, '0_Config_Lists'!PropertyListRange, ColumnNumberOfSpecificRate, FALSE)), '0_Config_Lists'!DefaultRateCell, VLOOKUP(B5, '0_Config_Lists'!PropertyListRange, ColumnNumberOfSpecificRate, FALSE))
(Note: Error handling for VLOOKUP like IFERROR might be needed, or using XLOOKUP if your Excel version supports it, for a cleaner formula.)
Calculated_Westerley_Commission (Formula: =Gross_Income_Booking * Commission_Rate_Applied)
3. 2_Master_Ledger (Master Data Sheet):
When a "Booking" transaction is moved from 1_Transaction_Input to 2_Master_Ledger, the following must be copied as values:
Gross_Income_Booking
Commission_Rate_Applied (The actual percentage rate used for that specific booking)
Calculated_Westerley_Commission (The dollar amount of the commission for that booking)
This ensures that if you later change the Default_Overall_Commission_Rate or a Property_Specific_Commission_Rate in 0_Config_Lists, the commission for past, already-logged bookings remains unchanged, preserving historical accuracy.
4. Property_[PropertyName/ID] Sheets (Property Owner Reports):
When calculating Westerley's commission for the owner's report:
This sheet will sum the Calculated_Westerley_Commission values from 2_Master_Ledger for all relevant bookings for that property in the period.
Optionally, you could also display the Commission_Rate_Applied for each booking for full transparency to the owner.
How to Handle Commission Rate Changes:
To Change the Default Overall Commission Rate:
Go to 0_Config_Lists.
Update the value in the Default_Overall_Commission_Rate cell.
All new booking transactions entered for properties that do not have a Property_Specific_Commission_Rate will now use this new default rate. Past bookings remain unaffected.
To Set or Change a Commission Rate for an Individual Property:
Go to 0_Config_Lists and find the relevant property in the "Property List".
Enter or modify the percentage in the Property_Specific_Commission_Rate column for that property.
All new booking transactions for this specific property will now use this specific rate.
To revert a property to using the default rate, simply clear the value in its Property_Specific_Commission_Rate cell.
Again, past bookings for this property remain unaffected in the 2_Master_Ledger.
This approach gives you the required flexibility:
A general commission rate for most properties.
The ability to easily set custom rates for individual properties.
The ability to update either the general rate or specific rates, with changes only affecting future transactions, ensuring your historical financial records are stable and accurate.

## PROMPT ##

can we do a prototype of this system using excel

---

## RESPONSE ##

Yes, absolutely! While I can't directly create and hand you an Excel file, I can guide you step-by-step through creating a functional prototype of this system in Excel. We'll define the sheets, columns, formulas, and even some test data.
Let's start building your Excel prototype.
Step 1: Create a New Excel Workbook
Open Microsoft Excel and create a new, blank workbook.
Save it with a name like Westerley_Property_Management_Prototype.xlsx.
Step 2: Set up 0_Config_Lists Sheet
This sheet will hold all your lookup lists and global settings.
Rename the first sheet to 0_Config_Lists.
Global Settings:
In cell A1, type: Setting
In cell B1, type: Value
In cell A2, type: Default_Overall_Commission_Rate
In cell B2, enter 15% (or your typical rate). Format cell B2 as a Percentage.
In cell A3, type: Current_Year (Optional, but can be useful for reports)
In cell B3, enter 2025.
Property List:
Starting in cell D1, create the following headers:
D1: Property_ID
E1: Property_Name
F1: Owner_Name
G1: Property_Specific_Commission_Rate (Format this column as Percentage)
Enter some sample property data:
Property_ID Property_Name Owner_Name Property_Specific_Commission_Rate
P001 Beachside Bliss John Smith
P002 Forest Retreat Jane Doe 12%
P003 Town Centre Apartment Alice Brown
P004 Ocean View Villa Bob Green 18%
Export to Sheets
Make this an Excel Table: Select D1:G5 (or however many rows you add) and press Ctrl+T. Ensure "My table has headers" is checked. Click OK.
Name the Table: Click anywhere in the table. Go to the "Table Design" tab on the ribbon. In the "Table Name:" box (usually on the far left), change the name from "Table1" (or similar) to tblProperties.
Cleaner List:
Starting in cell I1, create the following headers:
I1: Cleaner_ID
J1: Cleaner_Name

For C2 (Transaction_Type): Data > Data Validation > Allow: List > Source: "Booking,Cleaning,Maintenance,Owner Payout" (type this in directly).
For D2 (Property_ID): Data > Data Validation > Allow: List > Source: =tblProperties[Property_ID].
For L2 (Cleaner_ID): Data > Data Validation > Allow: List > Source: =tblCleaners[Cleaner_ID].
For Q2 (Expense_Category): Data > Data Validation > Allow: List > Source: ='0_Config_Lists'!$M$2:$M$6 (adjust range if you add more).
Copy these data validation cells down a few rows.
Formulas (Enter these in row 2 and then drag down):
J2 (Commission_Rate_Applied):
Excel
=IF(C2="Booking", IFERROR(IF(XLOOKUP(D2, tblProperties[Property_ID], tblProperties[Property_Specific_Commission_Rate], "", 0)="", '0_Config_Lists'!$B$2, XLOOKUP(D2, tblProperties[Property_ID], tblProperties[Property_Specific_Commission_Rate], "", 0)), '0_Config_Lists'!$B$2), "")
This formula checks if the transaction type is "Booking". If so, it tries to find a property-specific commission rate. If not found or blank, it uses the default overall rate. If not a "Booking", it leaves the cell blank. Adjust '0_Config_Lists'!$B$2 if your Default Rate cell is different.
(If you don't have XLOOKUP, a VLOOKUP version is more complex: =IF(C2="Booking", IFERROR(IF(VLOOKUP(D2, tblProperties, MATCH("Property_Specific_Commission_Rate",tblProperties[#Headers],0), FALSE)="", '0_Config_Lists'!$B$2, VLOOKUP(D2, tblProperties, MATCH("Property_Specific_Commission_Rate",tblProperties[#Headers],0), FALSE)), '0_Config_Lists'!$B$2), "") - this requires the specific rate column to be to the right of Property_ID in the table). I'll use XLOOKUP for subsequent formulas as it's generally simpler if available.
K2 (Calculated_Westerley_Commission):
Excel
=IF(C2="Booking", I2*J2, "")
Calculates commission if it's a booking, otherwise blank.
O2 (Hourly_Rate_Applied):
Excel
=IF(C2="Cleaning", IFERROR(XLOOKUP(L2, tblCleaners[Cleaner_ID], tblCleaners[Current_Hourly_Pay_Rate], "", 0), ""), "")
If "Cleaning", looks up the cleaner's current hourly rate. Otherwise blank.
P2 (Calculated_Cleaning_Cost):
Excel
=IF(C2="Cleaning", N2*O2, "")
If "Cleaning", calculates hours * rate. Otherwise blank.
A2 (Transaction_ID): For simplicity in the prototype, you can use:
Excel
=IF(C2<>"", "TRN" & TEXT(ROW()-1,"000"), "")
This creates an ID like TRN001 if there's a transaction type, otherwise blank. Drag down.
Step 4: Set up 2_Master_Ledger Sheet
This sheet will be a historical log of all transactions. For the prototype, you will manually copy transactions here.
Create a new sheet and rename it 2_Master_Ledger.
Copy the headers from 1_Transaction_Input (A1:U1) and paste them into A1 of 2_Master_Ledger.
Important: Data in this sheet should be VALUES, not formulas (especially for calculated fields like commission and cleaning costs).
Make this an Excel Table: Once you have a few rows of data (after copying from input), select the data including headers, press Ctrl+T. Name this table tblLedger.
Workflow for Moving Data (Manual for Prototype):
Fill out a transaction in a row on 1_Transaction_Input.
Once complete and all formulas have calculated, select the entire row of data (e.g., A2:U2).
Copy (Ctrl+C).
Go to the 2_Master_Ledger sheet, find the next empty row.
Paste Special > Values (Alt+E+S+V then Enter, or Right-click > Paste Special > Values).
You can then clear the row in 1_Transaction_Input for the next entry.
(A simple VBA macro could automate this "Log Transaction" process, but let's stick to manual for now.)
Step 5: Example Data Entry & Logging
Let's enter a few transactions:
Booking 1 (Uses Default Commission):
Date_Recorded: 01/06/2025
Transaction_Type: Booking
Property_ID: P001
Booking_ID: BK001
Guest_Name: Test Guest 1
Check_In_Date: 10/06/2025
Check_Out_Date: 15/06/2025
Gross_Income_Booking: $1000
(Commission_Rate_Applied should show 15%, Calculated_Westerley_Commission $150)
Log this to 2_Master_Ledger.
Booking 2 (Uses Property-Specific Commission):
Date_Recorded: 01/06/2025
Transaction_Type: Booking
Property_ID: P002
Booking_ID: BK002
Guest_Name: Test Guest 2
Check_In_Date: 12/06/2025
Check_Out_Date: 16/06/2025
Gross_Income_Booking: $800
(Commission_Rate_Applied should show 12%, Calculated_Westerley_Commission $96)
Log this to 2_Master_Ledger.
Cleaning Job 1:
Date_Recorded: 01/06/2025
Transaction_Type: Cleaning
Property_ID: P001
Cleaner_ID: C01
Cleaning_Date: 15/06/2025
Cleaning_Hours_Worked: 4
(Hourly_Rate_Applied should show $30.00, Calculated_Cleaning_Cost $120.00)
Log this to 2_Master_Ledger.
Maintenance Job 1:
Date_Recorded: 02/06/2025
Transaction_Type: Maintenance
Property_ID: P002
Expense_Category: Maintenance - Plumbing
Expense_Description: Fix leaky tap kitchen
Expense_Amount: $75
Paid_By: Westerley
Log this to 2_Master_Ledger.
Step 6: Set up Property_Sheet_Example
This sheet will demonstrate a basic owner report for one property.
Create a new sheet. Rename it Prop_P001_Report.
Report Filters (at the top):
A1: Property ID:
B1: P001 (You'll type this in to select the property)
A2: Report Month Start:
B2: 01/06/2025 (Enter start date for report. Format as Date)
A3: Report Month End:
B3: 30/06/2025 (Enter end date for report. Format as Date)
Property & Owner Details (pulled from 0_Config_Lists):
A5: Property Name:
B5: =XLOOKUP(B1, tblProperties[Property_ID], tblProperties[Property_Name], "Not Found")
A6: Owner Name:
B6: =XLOOKUP(B1, tblProperties[Property_ID], tblProperties[Owner_Name], "Not Found")
Income Summary (for the selected property and period):
A8: Income
A9: Total Gross Bookings:
B9:
Excel
=SUMIFS(tblLedger[Gross_Income_Booking], tblLedger[Property_ID], B1, tblLedger[Check_In_Date], ">="&B2, tblLedger[Check_In_Date], "<="&B3, tblLedger[Transaction_Type], "Booking")
(This sums Gross_Income_Booking from tblLedger if Property_ID matches B1, Check_In_Date is within B2 and B3, and Transaction_Type is "Booking")
Westerley Commission Summary:
A11: Westerley Commission
A12: Total Commission:
B12:
Excel
=SUMIFS(tblLedger[Calculated_Westerley_Commission], tblLedger[Property_ID], B1, tblLedger[Check_In_Date], ">="&B2, tblLedger[Check_In_Date], "<="&B3, tblLedger[Transaction_Type], "Booking")
Expenses Summary (e.g., Cleaning & Maintenance paid by Westerley):
A14: Expenses (Paid by Westerley)
A15: Total Cleaning Costs:
B15:
Excel
=SUMIFS(tblLedger[Calculated_Cleaning_Cost], tblLedger[Property_ID], B1, tblLedger[Cleaning_Date], ">="&B2, tblLedger[Cleaning_Date], "<="&B3, tblLedger[Transaction_Type], "Cleaning")
A16: Total Maintenance Costs:
B16:
Excel
=SUMIFS(tblLedger[Expense_Amount], tblLedger[Property_ID], B1, tblLedger[Date_Recorded], ">="&B2, tblLedger[Date_Recorded], "<="&B3, tblLedger[Transaction_Type], "Maintenance", tblLedger[Paid_By], "Westerley")
(Note: Assuming Date_Recorded for maintenance for simplicity. You might use a specific expense date if you add one)
Net to Owner:
A18: Payment Calculation
A19: Net Amount Due to Owner:
B19: =B9-B12-B15-B16 (Gross Income - Commission - Cleaning - Maintenance)
Format currency fields appropriately.
Step 7: Set up Cleaner_Wages_Calc_Weekly_Example
Create a new sheet. Rename it Cleaner_C01_Wages.
Report Filters:
A1: Cleaner ID:
B1: C01 (Type cleaner ID here)
A2: Week Start Date:
B2: 09/06/2025 (Enter start date of pay week)
A3: Week End Date:
B3: 15/06/2025 (Enter end date of pay week)
Cleaner Details:
A5: Cleaner Name:
B5: =XLOOKUP(B1, tblCleaners[Cleaner_ID], tblCleaners[Cleaner_Name], "Not Found")
Jobs for the Week:
A7: Property_ID
B7: Cleaning_Date
C7: Hours_Worked
D7: Rate_Applied
E7: Job_Pay
(This section would ideally be populated by a FILTER formula if your Excel supports it dynamically. For a simpler prototype, we'll just do a total.)
Total Pay:
D9: Total Hours for Week:
E9:
Excel
=SUMIFS(tblLedger[Cleaning_Hours_Worked], tblLedger[Cleaner_ID], B1, tblLedger[Cleaning_Date], ">="&B2, tblLedger[Cleaning_Date], "<="&B3)
D10: Total Pay for Week:
E10:
Excel
=SUMIFS(tblLedger[Calculated_Cleaning_Cost], tblLedger[Cleaner_ID], B1, tblLedger[Cleaning_Date], ">="&B2, tblLedger[Cleaning_Date], "<="&B3)
If you want to list individual jobs (A7:E7 area):
This is more advanced for a simple prototype without dynamic array formulas or VBA. You could manually filter the tblLedger and copy-paste, or if you have newer Excel (Microsoft 365):
*In A8: =FILTER(tblLedger[[Property_ID]:[Calculated_Cleaning_Cost]], (tblLedger[Cleaner_ID]=B1) * (tblLedger[Cleaning_Date]>=B2) * (tblLedger[Cleaning_Date]<=B3) * (tblLedger[Transaction_Type]="Cleaning"), "No Jobs")
You'd then need to select the columns you want from this filter, e.g. by wrapping it in CHOOSECOLS or by referencing specific columns if FILTER returns multiple.
Next Steps & Testing:
Enter the sample data as described into 1_Transaction_Input and log it to 2_Master_Ledger.
Check if Prop_P001_Report shows the correct totals for P001 for June 2025.
Gross Income: $1000
Commission: $150
Cleaning: $120
Net: $1000 - $150 - $120 = $730
Check if Cleaner_C01_Wages shows the correct pay for C01 for the week ending 15/06/2025.
Total Hours: 4
Total Pay: $120
Test Rate Changes:
Go to 0_Config_Lists, change Cleaner_C01's rate to $35.00.
Enter a new cleaning job for C01 in 1_Transaction_Input. The Hourly_Rate_Applied should now be $35. Log it. The old job in 2_Master_Ledger should still show $30 rate and $120 cost.
Go to 0_Config_Lists, change Default_Overall_Commission_Rate to 17%.
Enter a new booking for P003 (which has no specific rate). The Commission_Rate_Applied should be 17%. Log it.
This should give you a solid starting prototype! Let me know how you go or if you hit any snags with specific formulas in your Excel version.

## PROMPT ##

okay, first can you edit the promptwe create to rfelct recent changes

---

## RESPONSE ##

Okay, I've edited the summary prompt to include our recent discussion about the flexible commission structure for Westerley. Here's the updated version:
Prompt for New Conversation:
"I am developing a spreadsheet-based software solution for 'Westerley,' a property management operation in Denmark, Western Australia. The current date for context is June 1, 2025.
Westerley's Business & Responsibilities:
Manages holiday rental properties owned by third parties.
Responsible for:
Marketing properties (mainly via Airbnb).
Selling and making bookings.
Assisting staying customers (lost keys, emergencies, etc.).
Hiring and managing cleaners.
General maintenance of the properties.
Charges an overall fee, which is a percentage of the gross income for each property.
Software Aims & Key Requirements:
Make recording transactions and producing reports as simple and efficient as possible.
Particular attention to check accuracy and provide a system to locate errors.
Initial implementation will be a spreadsheet system.
Reporting Needs & Frequencies:
Property Owners: Monthly summary document detailing income, expenses, Westerley's fee, and the calculation of their payment.
Cleaners:
Weekly wage calculation for payment.
Yearly summary of their income.
Westerley Management:
Monthly payment calculations and property reports for owners.
Monthly summary reports for overall management.
Overall wages bill total (yearly) for workers' compensation insurance calculations.
Specific Detail on Cleaning Operations:
Cleaners are not tied to specific properties; they can be deployed at any property.
Cleaning work must be recorded in hours.
Cleaning costs and cleaner payments are driven by a current hourly pay rate specific to each cleaner.
These hourly pay rates may change occasionally. The system must reflect the rate current at the time of the work/data entry for new jobs, and this applied rate and calculated cost should be stored as fixed values. Past records should not change when a rate is updated.
Specific Detail on Commission Structure:
Westerley's property management fee (commission) is generally consistent across all properties and throughout the year.
However, the system must allow the flexibility to:
Set or change the commission rate for individual properties (as an override to the general rate).
Change the general (default) overall commission rate up or down, affecting properties that don't have a specific override.
Changes to rates should only affect future transactions, maintaining historical accuracy.
Proposed Spreadsheet Structure (Summary of Design):
The proposed system involves several interconnected sheets:
0_Config_Lists (Configuration & Lists):
Stores static data and global settings.
Global Settings Section: Includes Default_Overall_Commission_Rate.
Property List Section: Contains Property_ID, Property_Name, Owner_Name, and an optional Property_Specific_Commission_Rate column. If a value is in the specific rate column for a property, it overrides the default; otherwise, the default rate applies.
Cleaner List Section: Contains Cleaner_ID, Cleaner_Name, Contact, and Current_Hourly_Pay_Rate. Cleaner pay rates are updated here when they change.
Also lists Expense Categories, Booking Sources.
1_Transaction_Input (Data Entry Screen):
The primary sheet for recording ALL transactions.
Key Columns: Transaction_ID (unique), Date_Recorded, Transaction_Type (Dropdown: Booking, Cleaning, Maintenance, Owner Payout, etc.), Property_ID (Dropdown), Booking_ID, Guest_Name, Check_In_Date, Check_Out_Date, Gross_Income_Booking.
For "Booking" transactions:
Commission_Rate_Applied (Formula-driven: looks up Property_Specific_Commission_Rate first; if blank/not applicable, uses Default_Overall_Commission_Rate from 0_Config_Lists).
Calculated_Westerley_Commission (Formula: Gross_Income_Booking * Commission_Rate_Applied).
For "Cleaning" transactions: Cleaner_ID (Dropdown), Cleaning_Date, Cleaning_Hours_Worked (manual input), Hourly_Rate_Applied (auto-lookup from 0_Config_Lists based on Cleaner_ID), Calculated_Cleaning_Cost (formula: Hours * Rate_Applied).
For "Maintenance/Expense" transactions: Expense_Category, Expense_Description, Expense_Amount, Paid_By.
Extensive use of data validation is planned.
2_Master_Ledger (Master Data Sheet):
A clean, append-only log of all transactions from 1_Transaction_Input.
Data (especially calculated fields like Hourly_Rate_Applied, Calculated_Cleaning_Cost for cleaning jobs, and Commission_Rate_Applied, Calculated_Westerley_Commission for booking transactions) is copied here as values to preserve historical accuracy when rates change. This sheet is the single source of truth for all reports.
Property_[PropertyName/ID] Sheets (One per property):
Generates monthly reports for property owners.
Pulls data from 2_Master_Ledger (bookings with their calculated commission, cleaning costs, maintenance for that property).
Calculates: Total Gross Income, Total Westerley's Commission, Total Expenses, Net Payment to Owner.
Cleaner_Wages_Calc_Weekly Sheet:
Calculates weekly pay for each cleaner.
Pulls Cleaning_Hours_Worked, Hourly_Rate_Applied, and Calculated_Cleaning_Cost from 2_Master_Ledger for the selected cleaner and week.
Cleaners_Income_Summary_Yearly Sheet:
Provides a yearly income summary for each cleaner (total hours, total income).
Pulls and sums Calculated_Cleaning_Cost and Cleaning_Hours_Worked from 2_Master_Ledger.
Westerley_Mgmt_Summary_Monthly Sheet:
Overall financial summary for Westerley management (total gross income, total commission earned, total cleaning expenses paid, etc.).
Workers_Comp_Wages_Total_Yearly Sheet:
Calculates total wages paid to all cleaners for the year, primarily from Calculated_Cleaning_Cost totals.
Key Principles for the Design:
Data flows from 1_Transaction_Input to 2_Master_Ledger, then reports pull from 2_Master_Ledger.
Formulas like SUMIFS, VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP, FILTER (or QUERY in Google Sheets) will be used extensively.
Error checking through reconciliation, control totals, unique IDs, and data validation.
My goal is to continue developing this spreadsheet system based on these established requirements and design choices, starting with building an Excel prototype."

## PROMPT ##

if i give you an existing excel spreadsheet can you try to extract some useful information like expense categories so that we can start to create a prototyep

---

## RESPONSE ##

Yes, absolutely! While I can't directly open or access an Excel file from your computer, you can certainly copy and paste sections of your existing spreadsheet into our chat.
If you do that, I can definitely help you extract useful information like:
Expense Categories: If you paste a column or list of expenses you currently track, I can help identify unique categories to populate the Expense_Category list in our 0_Config_Lists sheet for the prototype.
Property Names/IDs: A list of your properties would be great for tblProperties.
Cleaner Names/IDs: This would help set up tblCleaners.
Typical Booking Information or Existing Column Headers: This can help ensure the 1_Transaction_Input sheet captures everything necessary.
How to do it:
Open your existing Excel spreadsheet.
Select the cells that contain the list of expense categories (or other relevant information).
Copy the selected cells (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C).
Paste the copied information into our chat window (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V).
For example, if you paste something like this from a column in your spreadsheet:
Plumbing Repairs
Cleaning Supplies - P001
Airbnb Service Fee
Electrician Callout - P003
Council Rates
Water Bill - P002
New Linens
Gardening Service
I could help you refine this into a more structured list of categories for the Expense_Category list in 0_Config_Lists, like:
Maintenance - Plumbing
Supplies - Cleaning
Booking Fees
Maintenance - Electrical
Property Taxes/Rates
Utilities - Water
Supplies - Linens
Maintenance - Gardening
And we could discuss if some of these (like "Cleaning Supplies - P001") should be a general category ("Supplies - Cleaning") with the property ID noted in the transaction details instead of being part of the category name itself.
So, please feel free to paste any lists or data you think would be helpful, starting with expense categories, and we can work through it together to build out the 0_Config_Lists sheet and make the prototype more relevant to your actual operations.

## PROMPT ##

cleaner names follow

---

## RESPONSE ##

Great! I'm ready when you are.
Once you provide the cleaner names, we can structure them into the tblCleaners table format we discussed for the 0_Config_Lists sheet in your Excel prototype. For each cleaner, we'll ideally want:
Cleaner_ID (e.g., C01, C02, or an abbreviation of their name)
Cleaner_Name (which you'll provide)
Current_Hourly_Pay_Rate (we can use placeholders if you don't have these handy right now, or you can provide them)
Looking forward to the list!

---

## PROMPT ##



---

## RESPONSE ##

Okay, I see the list of names from the image. Thanks for providing that!
Here are the names:
Jacobs
Antalova
Ide Araujo
Bernardi
Clememte
Schulze-Osthoff
Yamanaka
Let's structure these into the tblCleaners table for your 0_Config_Lists sheet in Excel. We'll need to assign a Cleaner_ID and then you can provide the Current_Hourly_Pay_Rate for each.
Here's a proposed way to set it up. You can adjust the Cleaner_ID if you have a different system in mind:
Cleaner_ID Cleaner_Name Current_Hourly_Pay_Rate
C01 Jacobs $ [Enter Rate Here]
C02 Antalova $ [Enter Rate Here]
C03 Ide Araujo $ [Enter Rate Here]
C04 Bernardi $ [Enter Rate Here]
C05 Clememte $ [Enter Rate Here]
C06 Schulze-Osthoff $ [Enter Rate Here]
C07 Yamanaka $ [Enter Rate Here]
C08 [Add more if needed] $ [Enter Rate Here]
Export to Sheets
Next Steps:
Could you please provide the current hourly pay rate for each of these cleaners?
Let me know if you'd like different Cleaner_IDs.
Once we have the rates, you can enter this table directly into the tblCleaners section of your 0_Config_Lists sheet in the Excel prototype we were discussing.

---

## PROMPT ##

current rate $40, this may vary per cleaner

---

## RESPONSE ##

Okay, great! So, if $40/hour is a common current rate, we can use that as a starting point. As you mentioned, this can vary per cleaner, and our table structure allows for that perfectly.
Here's the updated tblCleaners proposal for your 0_Config_Lists sheet, with $40.00 as the initial rate. Please review and adjust the rates for any cleaner who has a different one:
Cleaner_ID Cleaner_Name Current_Hourly_Pay_Rate
C01 Jacobs $40.00
C02 Antalova $40.00
C03 Ide Araujo $40.00
C04 Bernardi $40.00
C05 Clememte $40.00
C06 Schulze-Osthoff $40.00
C07 Yamanaka $40.00
C08 [Add more if needed] $40.00
Export to Sheets
Action for you:
Go into your 0_Config_Lists sheet in the Excel prototype.
Enter these names and IDs into the tblCleaners table (or update if you've already started).
Crucially, update the $40.00 in the Current_Hourly_Pay_Rate column for any specific cleaner whose actual rate is different. For example, if Antalova's rate is $42.50, you would change that in cell K3 (assuming your table starts with headers in row 1 and Jacobs is in row 2, and rates are in column K).
This setup ensures that when you select a Cleaner_ID in the 1_Transaction_Input sheet, the correct, specific hourly rate for that cleaner will be looked up and applied to calculate their cleaning cost for a job.
Do you have a list of properties or expense categories you'd like to work on next for the 0_Config_Lists sheet?

## PROMPT ##

properties:Arts Corner
La Casseta
James on Tuckfield

## RESPONSE ##

Okay, I have the list of property names. This is excellent for populating the tblProperties table in your 0_Config_Lists sheet.
Here are the names:
Arts Corner
La Casseta
James on Tuckfield
Boulters
South Beach Cottage
South Beach Studio
William’s
Sunset View
Let's structure these for the tblProperties table. We'll assign a Property_ID, list the Property_Name, and then you'll need to provide the Owner_Name for each. The Property_Specific_Commission_Rate column can be left blank if the default commission rate applies, or you can enter a specific rate if it's different for that property.
Here’s how it could look:
Property_ID Property_Name Owner_Name Property_Specific_Commission_Rate
P001 Arts Corner [Enter Owner Name Here]
P002 La Casseta [Enter Owner Name Here]
P003 James on Tuckfield [Enter Owner Name Here]
P004 Boulters [Enter Owner Name Here]
P005 South Beach Cottage [Enter Owner Name Here]
P006 South Beach Studio [Enter Owner Name Here]
P007 William’s [Enter Owner Name Here]
P008 Sunset View [Enter Owner Name Here]
P009 [Add more if needed] [Enter Owner Name Here]
Export to Sheets
Next Steps for you:
For each property, please provide the Owner's Name.
If any of these properties have a commission rate that is different from your Default_Overall_Commission_Rate (which we set to 15% as a placeholder in 0_Config_Lists), please specify that rate in the last column. Otherwise, leaving it blank is fine.
Let me know if you'd prefer different Property_IDs.
Once you provide the owner names (and any specific commission rates), you can enter this information into the tblProperties section of your 0_Config_Lists sheet in the Excel prototype.

## PROMPT ##

Can you create some sample data for the creation of basic files required to set up a prototye, I guess stored as google docs

---

## RESPONSE ##

Okay, I can definitely help you create some sample data. This will be useful for populating the basic "files" or sheets needed to set up your prototype.
While you mention Google Docs, for tabular data like this (which mirrors what we'd put in an Excel spreadsheet), Google Sheets would be the more appropriate tool. It functions like Excel and will allow you to use formulas and data validation more effectively later on. You can easily copy and paste the data I provide into a Google Sheet.
Here's some sample data for your 0_Config_Lists sheet and a few example transactions for your 1_Transaction_Input (which you would then copy as values to your 2_Master_Ledger).
Sample Data for 0_Config_Lists Sheet
You would create a sheet in Google Sheets named 0_Config_Lists and input the following:
1. Global Settings:
Setting Value
Default_Overall_Commission_Rate 15%
Current_Year 2025
Export to Sheets
2. tblProperties (Property List):
(I've added dummy owner names and some example specific commission rates. Please adjust these to your actual data.)

Sample Data for 1_Transaction_Input Sheet (Example Transactions)
You would create a sheet named 1_Transaction_Input with the columns we discussed. Here are a few examples. Remember, the fields Commission_Rate_Applied, Calculated_Westerley_Commission, Hourly_Rate_Applied, and Calculated_Cleaning_Cost would ideally be calculated by formulas in your sheet based on the inputs and data from 0_Config_Lists. I've shown the expected calculated values here for clarity.
When you log these to 2_Master_Ledger, you would copy these rows and paste as values.

Set up 1_Transaction_Input Columns: Add all the column headers we defined previously to your 1_Transaction_Input sheet.
Enter Example Transactions: Manually type (or copy-paste row by row) the example transactions into your 1_Transaction_Input sheet.
Set up the formulas for calculated fields (like Commission_Rate_Applied, Calculated_Westerley_Commission, Hourly_Rate_Applied, Calculated_Cleaning_Cost) in this sheet.
Populate 2_Master_Ledger: Copy the transaction rows from 1_Transaction_Input and use "Paste special > Paste values only" into the 2_Master_Ledger sheet.
This should give you a good foundation to start building out the formulas for your report sheets (like the Property_Sheet_Example and Cleaner_Wages_Calc_Weekly_Example we discussed for Excel). The principles and formulas will be very similar in Google Sheets.
Remember to replace dummy data like owner names and adjust rates to your actual figures as you develop the prototype further.

Can you create some sample data for the creation of basic files required to set up a prototye, I guess stored as google docs

## RESPONSE ##

You're looking for sample data to kickstart your prototype, and that's a great way to get things moving! As we discussed, Google Sheets will be the best "Google Doc" type for this, as it handles tables, formulas, and data much like Excel.
Here's a set of sample data you can copy and paste into your Google Sheets file.
Sample Data for 0_Config_Lists Sheet
Create a sheet in your Google Sheets file and name it 0_Config_Lists.
1. Global Settings:
(Place this at the top of the sheet, perhaps in columns A and B)
Setting Value
Default_Overall_Commission_Rate 15%
Current_Year 2025
Export to Sheets
2. tblProperties (Property List):
(You can format this as a table or just enter the data. I've used the property names you provided and added dummy owner names and some example specific commission rates.)
Property_ID Property_Name Owner_Name Property_Specific_Commission_Rate
P001 Arts Corner Eleanor Vance
P002 La Casseta Marcus Bell 13%
P003 James on Tuckfield Sofia Ramirez
P004 Boulters Leo Carter 17%
P005 South Beach Cottage Hannah Davis
P006 South Beach Studio Oscar Chen
P007 William’s Grace Miller 14.5%
P008 Sunset View Ethan Foster

3. tblCleaners (Cleaner List):
(Using the cleaner names from the image, with example hourly rates. Adjust as needed.)
Cleaner_ID Cleaner_Name Current_Hourly_Pay_Rate
C01 Jacobs $40.00
C02 Antalova $41.00
C03 Ide Araujo $40.00
C04 Bernardi $40.50
C05 Clememte $39.00
C06 Schulze-Osthoff $40.00
C07 Yamanaka $40.00

Sample Data for 1_Transaction_Input Sheet (Example Transactions)
Create another sheet and name it 1_Transaction_Input. Add the column headers we've previously defined. Here are some example transactions.
(Remember, in your actual sheet, columns like Commission_Rate_Applied, Calculated_Westerley_Commission, Hourly_Rate_Applied, and Calculated_Cleaning_Cost will be formulas. I'm showing the expected calculated values here.)

How to Use This Data in Google Sheets:
Create Sheets: In a new Google Sheets file, create a sheet named 0_Config_Lists, another named 1_Transaction_Input, and a third named 2_Master_Ledger.
Populate 0_Config_Lists: Copy the data tables provided above for "Global Settings," "tblProperties," "tblCleaners," "Expense Categories," and "Booking Sources" and paste them into the 0_Config_Lists sheet.
Set Up 1_Transaction_Input Columns: In the 1_Transaction_Input sheet, create all the column headers we've discussed for transactions.
Enter Example Transactions: Manually type or copy-paste the example transaction rows into your 1_Transaction_Input sheet.
You'll want to set up the formulas in the calculated columns (e.g., Calculated_Westerley_Commission) in this sheet so they populate automatically based on your inputs and the data in 0_Config_Lists.
Populate 2_Master_Ledger: Once transactions are entered (and formulas calculated) in 1_Transaction_Input, copy those rows and use "Paste special > Paste values only" into the 2_Master_Ledger sheet. This creates your historical log.
This sample data should give you a concrete starting point for building out your formulas and report sheets. Let me know when you're ready to think about the structure of the report sheets!

# **Project Summary: 009 thortStream**

## **Aim**

The **thortStream** project is a comprehensive system for acquiring, analyzing, and browsing a personal archive of Google Gemini conversations. Its primary goal is to create a durable, searchable, and self-contained static website from raw scraped data, ensuring long-term access and usability of the information.

## **Core Components**

The project is divided into three main functional areas, each with its own set of scripts and processes:

1. **Acquisition (src/01\_acquisition):**  
   * Scripts responsible for extracting chat metadata (chats.json) and the full content of each conversation from the web interface.  
2. **Analysis (src/02\_analysis):**  
   * Scripts that process the raw data, consolidate scattered chat files, and generate a master CSV report (chat\_analysis\_report.csv). This report serves as the single source of truth for the website builder. This phase also identifies anomalies like missing or misclassified files.  
3. **Website Generation (src/03\_website\_generation):**  
   * A Python script (build\_website\_content.py) that reads the master CSV report and populates a set of HTML and JavaScript templates to build the final, public-facing static website. This includes generating a search index for client-side searching.

## **Next Steps & Future Development**

* **New Acquisitions:** Develop a more streamlined process for adding new chats from various sources (e.g., manual copy-paste, new scraping sessions) and integrating them into the existing archive.  
* **Artifact Integration:** Implement a workflow for processing a Google Takeout export to find and link associated artifacts (images, generated documents) to their respective conversations.  
* **Curation & Tagging:** Explore adding a metadata layer to the system, allowing for manual tagging or categorization of chats to improve organization and searchability.
